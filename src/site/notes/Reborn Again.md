###### The campaign follows our party as they are  navigating the chaos of a world on the brink of destruction, caught between a demonic invasion, political turmoil, and ancient secrets resurfacing. Set primarily in **[[Reborn Again/Locations Gone to/Tallan/Tallon City\|Tallon]] City**, the party has fought to defend it from **cultists, demons, and warlords**, uncovering the sinister plans of the **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Demons/CULTS/The White Spears\|Cult of the Last Days]]**, who wield corrupted divine shards to reshape the world. Alongside military battles and supernatural conflicts, the party contends with **Fae Court politics, lost technology, and the resurfacing of forgotten legends**—including [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]]'s connection to ancient warforged, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]]’s struggle against her monstrous past, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]’s ties to vampiric bloodlines, and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]’s link to divine forces. As they prepare for their next mission to **[[Reborn Again/Locations Gone to/Westvale/Westvale\|Westvale]]**, where all contact has been lost, they face not just external enemies but the weight of their own histories, the shifting balance of power, and the question of what it truly means to be a hero.
