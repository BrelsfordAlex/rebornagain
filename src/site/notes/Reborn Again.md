###### The campaign follows our party as they are  navigating the chaos of a world on the brink of destruction, caught between a demonic invasion, political turmoil, and ancient secrets resurfacing. Set primarily in **[[Reborn Again/Locations Gone to/Tallan/Tallon City\|Tallon]] City**, the party has fought to defend it from **cultists, demons, and warlords**, uncovering the sinister plans of the **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Demons/CULTS/The White Spears\|Cult of the Last Days]]**, who wield corrupted divine shards to reshape the world. Alongside military battles and supernatural conflicts, the party contends with **Fae Court politics, lost technology, and the resurfacing of forgotten legends**—including [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]]'s connection to ancient warforged, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]]’s struggle against her monstrous past, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]’s ties to vampiric bloodlines, and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]’s link to divine forces. As they prepare for their next mission to **[[Reborn Again/Locations Gone to/Westvale/Westvale\|Westvale]]**, where all contact has been lost, they face not just external enemies but the weight of their own histories, the shifting balance of power, and the question of what it truly means to be a hero.

# Summary of Session 27
### **Quick Recap (29th-31st of Springdawn)**

The **party arrived at a vault runner settlement** near the **Necropolis Vault**, where they were confronted by **a Panther Shifter woman who recognized Viv as "Violet"—his mother, Councilwoman Bagrov**. She ordered her men to stand down, but tensions flared when she joked about shooting Maria early if she proved dangerous. The party entered **the "Nuts and Bolts Bar & Grill,"** where they met **Penny, a heavily modified Warforged who recognized THEM as her creator**. THEM and Penny shared a heartfelt reunion, while Maria **searched for demonic activity, only to find signs of past fey attacks**.

During discussions, **the Councilwoman pulled a gun on THEM** after learning of his connection to **Magnus**, who is suspected to be inside the vault. **Maria and THEM defused the situation**, and it was revealed that Magnus **bought Circle Magic from the settlement**, further increasing his threat. The party **prepared for their mission into the vault**, gathering **potions, relics, and magical items**.

Meanwhile, **Evergreen sneaked away to her destroyed hometown**, finding **nothing left except a cursed church**, which she **obliterated with the help of Baba Yelena**. **THEM later realized he had lived in the same town centuries earlier,** suggesting possible **time manipulation or long-term planning by unknown forces**.

The next day, **Maria used divine magic to push back Magnus' corruption, rejuvenating miles of land**, while the party finalized their vault strategy. They learned that **the Vault Core is on Level 7**, and if they **disable it, the vault will stop shifting**. However, the **Vault Guardian, Kalani ("The Reaper"), is actively killing intruders**. THEM believes **Kalani can be reasoned with**, but **Bagrov disagrees**.

Later that evening, the **party cooked a final meal together, bonding before their mission**. **Bagrov returned from demon hunting, completely unharmed, and officially made Viv the party leader**. With **9 days remaining before Magnus completes his plan**, the group agreed to **wake at 4 AM, finalize their supplies, and enter the vault at sunrise**.

Now, **with a clear goal ahead—reaching Level 7 to disable the Core—the party is ready to descend into the Necropolis Vault.**
