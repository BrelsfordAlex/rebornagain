###### The campaign follows our party as they are  navigating the chaos of a world on the brink of destruction, caught between a demonic invasion, political turmoil, and ancient secrets resurfacing. Set primarily in **[[Reborn Again/Locations Gone to/Tallan/Tallon City\|Tallon]] City**, the party has fought to defend it from **cultists, demons, and warlords**, uncovering the sinister plans of the **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Demons/CULTS/The White Spears\|Cult of the Last Days]]**, who wield corrupted divine shards to reshape the world. Alongside military battles and supernatural conflicts, the party contends with **Fae Court politics, lost technology, and the resurfacing of forgotten legends**—including [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]]'s connection to ancient warforged, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]]’s struggle against her monstrous past, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]’s ties to vampiric bloodlines, and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]’s link to divine forces. As they prepare for their next mission to **[[Reborn Again/Locations Gone to/Westvale/Westvale\|Westvale]]**, where all contact has been lost, they face not just external enemies but the weight of their own histories, the shifting balance of power, and the question of what it truly means to be a hero.

# **Session Recap**


**Date:** _31st of Springdawn, 2451 PS_  
**Location:** _Ancient Protomagai Vault_

---

## **Summary**

The party ventured into an ancient vault rumored to house an Elder Brain, navigating its shifting rooms using a limited-use compass and Myria's hand-drawn maps. Inside, they faced a series of challenges—deadly traps, magical puzzles, and constructs—all while unraveling the vault’s mysteries.

The vault, created by the long-lost **Protomagai** civilization, realigns its layout every 200 years, with time anomalies accelerating this process. The **Forge Room** in particular altered the shifting cycle, adding urgency to the party’s exploration.

The group ultimately encountered a corrupted **Elder Brain**, infected by ichor and manipulated by a lurking **Mind Flayer**. Rather than destroying the brain, the party chose a more compassionate path—cleansing it of corruption. This act not only freed the Elder Brain but also earned its guidance deeper into the vault.

---

    - **Viv Baine** faced frequent tentacle grabs, leading to both danger and comedic moments.
    - Summoned **Marcus Menneth** during the final battle against the **Mind Flayer**.
- **Elder Brain Dilemma:**
    
    - Debated whether to destroy or cleanse the corrupted Elder Brain.
    - Used **Lesser Restoration** and celestial aid to cleanse it.
    - Fought the **Mind Flayer**, who escaped via **plane shift** after defeat.
