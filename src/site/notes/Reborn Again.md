###### The campaign follows our party as they are  navigating the chaos of a world on the brink of destruction, caught between a demonic invasion, political turmoil, and ancient secrets resurfacing. Set primarily in **[[Reborn Again/Locations Gone to/Tallan/Tallon City\|Tallon]] City**, the party has fought to defend it from **cultists, demons, and warlords**, uncovering the sinister plans of the **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Demons/CULTS/The White Spears\|Cult of the Last Days]]**, who wield corrupted divine shards to reshape the world. Alongside military battles and supernatural conflicts, the party contends with **Fae Court politics, lost technology, and the resurfacing of forgotten legends**—including [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]]'s connection to ancient warforged, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]]’s struggle against her monstrous past, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]’s ties to vampiric bloodlines, and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]’s link to divine forces. As they prepare for their next mission to **[[Reborn Again/Locations Gone to/Westvale/Westvale\|Westvale]]**, where all contact has been lost, they face not just external enemies but the weight of their own histories, the shifting balance of power, and the question of what it truly means to be a hero.

# **Key Events:**

1. **Myria and THEM’s Debate Over Looting the Dead:**
    
    - Viv insisted on returning bodies to their families, while Myria argued they wouldn’t miss their belongings. THEM, somewhat exasperated, just handed Myria gold to shut down the argument.
2. **Descending Into the Underground Farm:**
    
    - The party discovered a massive underground agricultural zone with sentient crops.
    - Myria attempted to communicate with the plants, but they were initially hostile.
    - Wheat stalks lashed out to entangle the group, forcing them into combat.
    - Maria and Viv opted to run for the exit, while Myria gradually befriended the flora.
    - The plants eventually aided Myria’s travel, offering seeds as a sign of goodwill.
3. **Kalani’s Presence and the First Fight:**
    
    - The party encountered **Kalani**, an advanced warforged entity tasked with guarding the vault.
    - THEM attempted to reason with Kalani, explaining Magnus’ crimes, but Kalani remained steadfast in their duty.
    - A brutal battle ensued, during which Myria used **Mind Spike** to track Kalani’s location, and Maria landed a devastating smite.
    - THEM began to use **arbitration authority** to introduce a glitch in Kalani’s system, disrupting their command structure.
    - As the fight progressed, Kalani **shut down**, though it was unclear for how long.
4. **The Dragon’s Liberation and Intel on Magnus:**
    
    - Maria successfully freed **Em, an ancient amethyst dragon** trapped by the proto-magi.
    - Em provided information on Magnus’ plans, confirming that in **nine days**, Magnus’ **perfect vessel** would be complete.
    - Em also gave the group a **shortcut to the vault’s seventh level**, where the core could be accessed directly.
    - Viv made a request for Em to deliver the bodies to Councilwoman Highgrove.
    - THEM gifted Em a magical hammer for their journey.
5. **Splitting the Party:**
    
    - **Viv, accompanied by a ghoul, went alone to secure Luna’s relic.**
    - **The rest of the party moved toward the vault’s core, hoping to shut it down before Kalani reactivated.**

### **Current Status:**

- **Kalani is temporarily shut down** but still healing.
- **Viv is separated from the group, heading toward Luna’s relic.**
- **The main party is en route to the core, hoping to stop Magnus’ plan before it’s too late.**
- **The vault remains unstable**
