### Planning Operation Greenleaf
####  [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]] and the Group:

[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]] lays out the objectives of Operation Greenleaf:
- Secure the hidden city.
- Destroy idols, statues, and artifacts tied to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Kor'ad\|Khorad]] in [[Reborn Again/Locations Gone to/Westvale/The Summer Court\|the Summer Court]].
- Confront and defeat [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Kor'ad\|Khorad]] in honorable combat.
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]] emphasizes the need for secrecy, particularly keeping the plan hidden from [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]] to prevent her self-sacrificing tendencies from interfering.
[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]’s Response:

- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]’s anger surfaces during the discussion. She clenches her sword, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the White/Vengence\|Vengeance]], visibly struggling to suppress her rage toward [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Kor'ad\|Khorad]].
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]] advises her to channel her anger constructively, warning that emotional outbursts could give [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Kor'ad\|Khorad]] an advantage.
[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Vivienne]] and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]]:

- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Vivienne]] expresses his trust in [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]], referencing [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Luna\|Luna]]’s advice. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]] is visibly relieved by this reassurance, as their ability to lead depends heavily on the group’s confidence in [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|them]].
