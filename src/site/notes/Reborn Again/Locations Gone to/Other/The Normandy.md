#### **General Overview**

- **Affiliation:**
    
    - The Normandy is a Talon warship, identified as a key vessel in Talon’s experimental operations.
    - Its mission prior to its abandonment was the transport of bio-demons, including a **Patriarch-Class Demon**, to Mizzix for further research or potential deployment.
- **Condition:**
    
    - When encountered, the Normandy was severely damaged and adrift, with smoke rising from parts of the ship.
    - Acid burns, claw marks, and signs of intense combat were found throughout, suggesting a catastrophic containment breach.

---

#### **Interior Description**

- **Deck and Structure:**
    
    - The ship’s exterior and deck bore signs of a violent attack, including broken masts, scorched metal, and acidic corrosion.
    - The interior was heavily damaged, with collapsed corridors, pools of acid, and evidence of failed containment protocols.
- **Containment Cells:**
    
    - The Normandy housed containment cells designed for holding bio-demons.
    - These cells were found breached, with structural damage indicating that the bio-demons had escaped violently.
- **Crew Areas:**
    
    - Corpses of Talon crew members littered the ship, many showing signs of acid burns, claw wounds, and other injuries inflicted during the bio-demons’ rampage.
- **Captain’s Quarters:**
    
    - A locked safe in the captain’s quarters contained valuable loot, including potential magical items and information, accessed with assistance from [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]].

#### **Mission and Catastrophic Failure**

- **Purpose:**
    
    - The Normandy’s mission was to transport bio-demons for research or deployment under Talon’s orders.
    - It was heading to **Mizzix**, a location or organization with ties to Talon’s experimental projects.
- **Failure and Breach:**
    
    - A containment breach occurred aboard the ship, likely due to inadequate safety measures or underestimating the strength of the bio-demons.
    - This breach led to the escape of the bio-demons, resulting in the deaths of the entire crew and rendering the ship adrift.

#### **Encounters and Threats**

- **Dragon-like Demon:**
    
    - A massive acid-spitting creature tied to "[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Demons/It That Hungers\|It That Hungers]]" was encountered near the Normandy.
    - This creature appeared territorial and predatory, guarding the ship from intruders.
- **Bio-Demons:**
    
    - Several bio-demons remained active aboard the Normandy, including Gene-Stealer-like creatures and possibly others still under the influence of the Patriarch-Class Demon.
    - These creatures used the ship’s layout to their advantage, setting ambushes in confined spaces.

#### **Key Events Involving the Normandy**

- **Detection and Approach:**
    
    - [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/THEM\|THEM]] and the [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/On the Epoch/Epoch\|Epoch]] parties detected the Normandy as a potential site for exploration.
    - Concerns about structural instability and remaining threats were raised before boarding.
- **Exploration and Findings:**
    
    - Evidence of Talon’s failed containment and bio-demon experiments was uncovered.
    - Data logs and partial records hinted at the scope of Talon’s operations but were mostly corrupted.
- **Loot and Artifacts:**
    
    - Valuable items, including a **Staff of Lightning and Thunder**, spell scrolls, ammunition, and ritual books, were recovered from the Normandy.
    - Explosive barrels and arcane cannonballs were found, highlighting the ship’s military capabilities.

#### **Strategic Importance**

- **Connection to Talon:**
    
    - The Normandy serves as a critical piece of evidence in understanding Talon’s dangerous experiments and their potential misuse of bio-demons.
    - Its failure underscores the risks of experimenting with entities tied to "[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Demons/It That Hungers\|It That Hungers]]."
- **Ongoing Threats:**
    
    - The dragon-like demon and remaining bio-demons aboard the ship pose a continuing danger to those exploring its remains.
