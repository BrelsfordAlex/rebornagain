[[Reborn Again/Session Notes/Session 29- Invasion of the Leaf People!\|Session 29- Invasion of the Leaf People!]]
**DM**: As long as its [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] isn't being idiotic, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]] will agree with [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]]. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]] will not go against their character. You are keeping the 16. Don't don't worry.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Okay.
**DM**: Right. So you guys are in mine's room. You've watched, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] chuck bodies into a bag for about ten minutes.
**DM**: That reminds me. I need to get my pad out. Oh, yeah. Give me one moment because I need to mark time segments again.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: You said it was 8AM last time. 08:30? Okay.
**DM**: And a half hours have passed.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: That woman just looks at [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] and just goes, what you gonna do with [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] later?
**DM**: It's only fitting they get a proper burial, isn't it?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: They're not using the money that they have on [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]].
**DM**: No. Absolutely not.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I mean, logically, they're not using it.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/On the Epoch/Eden\|Eden]]could use more.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Just kinda like, slowly turns head towards [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]].
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Logically, I don't mind from the animal piece first.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Say that again, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Logically I believe we should try and return [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] to their families in one piece first.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Logically, they don't know if their items have been taken or not.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: We could just say, sorry, looks like some looks like the people got to it first. Brave robbers.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Don't know what else is in this vault. Some creatures from the vault could have taken it.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Quite frankly, I'm insulted.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: We should have [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] taken back. It's only fair.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I'm not saying we're not. I'm just saying take the money.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I'm poor.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]], if you're poor, I have 457 gold I could just give you.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I have 36 gold to my name.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Just like takes, takes his hand, puts it in his pocket and hands [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|evergreen]] a hundred gold.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: You have a hundred and 30 gold now. You happy?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Can we either stop yapping and either go down the level or go back home?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I Mean, there's a door that way, and I point to the other other an other door, and I say, there's also that way too.
**DM**: You know that your map is pointing down.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Yeah. The Core is down. I'm curious of what else is on this floor.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Regardless of whatever we do, can we just get out of here? I do not like the acid room.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Yeah. How'd you feel after those tentacles yeah. No.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Just, like, looks the other way and covers his face.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: I think you wish to say.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: It's just [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Hawthorn\|Hawthorne]] one of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Hawthorn\|Hawthorne]]'s fantasies, that's all.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Hey, don't be telling [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] my business.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: You've read the books in the on the ship's library.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: You do too.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: No. We don't. Not in the library.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Oh, give me strength.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: We're going down.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Yep. Looks like it.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Wanna touch the flush walls?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Don't say that.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Which [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]] touches the walls and goes, oh, fleshy.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Oh, I'm gonna have a heart attack, and I don't even have a heart. He just, like, looks down the hole.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: What she said. Your mother.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Wonder what's down there.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: And then that just internally goes, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the White/Honor\|Honor]]. How many brain cells are we losing because of this charade again?
**DM**: Some not that you have many.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Alright. We're going down.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I'm yellin at Timber.
**DM**: Who is going first?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Since I'm already by the hole, that's what she said, shut the fuck up. I'd probably go down the hole first.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I don't [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]] and then [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]].
**DM**: Okay. Who's next? [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]], And then [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]]'s bringing up the rear. Mainly just so that, like, 
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:me and Yeah. At the bottom to fucking catch [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|evergreen]] if she slips. 
**DM**: It's a ladder. You're all capable of playing with a ladder.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] has, like, climbing speed.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: She actively climbs walls for fun.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: What's your point? 
**DM**:[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]]'s is better.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:  Is it? 
**DM**:Yeah. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]] just walks up and down walls and on ceilings.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:  Oh, yes. 
**DM**:You all go down these stairs and you enter a large room and for a second you think you're outside.
**DM**: Because this is a massive room.
**DM**: It is probably a couple of thousand feet across.
**DM**: And there is what looks like artificial sunlight from the ceiling. The ceiling looks like open sky.
**DM**: And there are fields of crops in here.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: How far away are their crops?
**DM**: They are everywhere of every different variety.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: So I'll probably start hearing [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] speak then.
**DM**: You have to talk to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] first.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: It does not say that. It just says that the sentient.
**DM**: Uh-huh. There is no change.
**DM**: Can I give you my phone instead? Yeah.
**DM**: You go. Enjoy.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: What kind of crops?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: That's fine.
**DM**: A mix. There's like root veg. There are things that look a bit like wheat, but it looks older. It looks like grown for purpose. It looks like almost like they're starting to, like, genetically modify [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]. But with your passive perception,
**DM**: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]]. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]]. And [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], actually. Yes. These crops are moving weirdly.
**DM**: Like, even before you get close to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]], have a great day. They are moving slightly weird.
**DM**: You do see there is a there is a bronze star at the end of the room.
**DM**: There is a silver door to the left about halfway through the room, and there is a gold door to the right.
**DM**: You have come in at the south of this room, like, down a ladder.
**DM**: No. There are no traps. There are plants. There are plants that are moving weirdly all around you, though.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]] shouts hello.
**DM**: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]], can you make me a dexterity saving throw, please?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I have advantage on this.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: 26.
**DM**: 26. So you see you all see this. One of the plants.
**DM**: One of these, like, wheat plants, like, several of the, stems shoot out to try and wrap around [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|evergreen]]'s ankle. But [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]], you see this coming, you just, like, jump back. I would like you all to roll initiative, please.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Initiative is dexs as well, isn't it?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Oh, boy. I got a two.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: You Have advantage. You're within 
**DM**:Nope. 
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:That's not that you've been. 
**DM**: Nope. That's not [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]. That was your one shot character that had that. 
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Oh, shit. Sorry. My fault.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Initiative?
**DM**: Yeah. Initiative.
**DM**: Yeah. And [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]] is 15, and I will actually pull up
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:Someone's sheet? Oh, wait. Shit. Well I'm not putting fire 23. Yeah. I have a level of exhaustion. Oh, yeah.
**DM**: No. What a shame.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I did something to fix the exhaustion.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Don't want to use it yet, I know what ink is like.
**DM**:I'm not gonna paralyze you, what are you talking about? Not again.
**DM**: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]] is a six feet.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Nice. Yep. 16.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Again, me too.
**DM**: 16. So top of the round for four, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]. Can everyone please make me dexterity saving for it? 
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:I have this one. Everyone.
**DM**: Haven't taken a short rest yet. Right? Oh, yeah.
**DM**: 15,23, the one I'm actually everyone gets a plus four. Okay. 20 5.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Okay. So that would be, '19.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Okay. Good. I'm glad I got that plus four.
**DM**: 20 2. 20 2. Yeah. You're all fine. You're all fine. The DC is 17. None of you fail. Yeah. That's another 23. So more of these plants around you just start lashing out trying to grab you Mhmm. And just drag you in. Like, one catches [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]'s arm for a second, starts pulling [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] into like one of these rows of wheat next to you. But just quick as a flash, claws out, cut right through it. And you just hear [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] yell, I'm not playing Technical Monster two point zero with the fucking worm, like.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Fuck. I have to roll I have to roll for the ghouls for the ded. Hold on.
**DM**: Would you like [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] to be in Hammerspace for ease?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Yes. One of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] still holds the Feyfruit in the jar of dirt.
**DM**: Okay. They are currently in Hammerspace. If they come out to do anything, they will have to make these steps.
**DM**: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], you're up. What are you gonna do?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: No. I love where it says when they got up, they couldn't get in. Yeah. But it does look at the people to see if someone's there. But I assume that you heard me walking up. Yeah.
**DM**: Okay. 
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: hit with [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the White/Honor\|Honor]].
**DM**: Hit what what are you targeting?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Anyway, hi, Jenny.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I'm joined so that, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]] doesn't have to agree up with everything that [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]] says.
**DM**: There were no vines. These are like the grass the stems of the wheat are like distending and grabbing at you.
**DM**: Okay. So are you going what are you going to attack?
**DM**: That we Okay. Make it attack rule.
**DM**: No. 
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:19. 
**DM**: Hits. You Do not get a sneak attack. Wheat does not have vulnerable areas you can exploit. Cool. You cut down 10 stems of wheat in about a million.
**DM**: Hopefully. What else would you like to do? Are you going to talk with your allies? From any
**DM**: Which is the gun that has
**DM**: So in this room, the quarter you were in just now, so, like, the first fourth of the room is wheat. Then it seems to be some sort of root vegetable. Then it seems to be some sort of grape. Then at the very end, just in front of the door to the on the other side is some sort of, almost rice plant. You see water.
**DM**: Like, race patties at the very end?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Which way is the map for you with?
**DM**: The map the map is pointing left, so about halfway through this room.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: So to the silver door.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: I have an idea, but it's probably stupid. Can I first get a description of, like, how many feet is it, like, just our round offs in general? 
**DM**:Yes. You are in a large do you know the large fields of wheat? 
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: That's a bad idea then. I'm not doing that.
**DM**: I cannot wait for one of you to set this place on fire. 
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: That's why I was thinking about doing that.
**DM**: Now that you've said that about that, that bill. It's like maybe 500 square foot of wheat. But, like, in a rectangle shape.
**DM**: Don't really know if there's anything I can do. Not really. Start moving?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Alright, guys. I'm here. What's up what is this about me not agreeing with everything that [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]] says?
**DM**: Oh, I randomly determined which person MPC [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]] would agree with.
**DM**: I don't rule that.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: That was not a good move. That was not a good move.
**DM**: For you K,
**DM**: The you guys you've gone down this ladder from mine's room.
**DM**: And you've entered this large, almost artificially outside, field.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: This is all underground.
**DM**: The field is split into, like, four sections. The section you're currently in, which is about 300 feet is wheat. Then there's another 300 foot section of root vegetables. Then there is a 300 section of grapes, and there is a 300 foot section of rice paddies. And the room itself is about a thousand feet wide. This is all underground.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Jesus. Alright.
**DM**: And these plants are alive, and they have started attacking you.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Well, fuck.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Oh, it was just like the 10 tools.
**DM**: Specifically specifically, the wheat is trying to grab you guys and drag you places. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]] is a way that you guys need to get yeah. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]] is a way you need to get to a dollar about halfway through this room. So pass the wheat and then pass the root vegetables.
**DM**: Don't know what to do. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] has taken their turn, and they have cut, like You said 10. 10, bits of wheat down in a single swing in a field of about a million stems of wheat.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Not gonna be able to fight our way through this. We gotta run.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: We need to get through this.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Or we could just talk to
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: They don't really seem like the kind of person to talk to.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Oh, yeah. Talk oh, oh, yeah. Talk to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]. Talk to the thing that's actively trying to kill us. That's a that's a great idea.
**DM**: I mean, not the dumbest idea.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: This is their home. We are invading their home.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: I mean, the faster we get out of their home, the better.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:Me, technically, but I don't know what I wanna do.
**DM**: Yeah. You've got your movement and your bonus action. You're just gonna start pelting it towards that door?  Mm-mm. Has that [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]], have you actually said which door people need to leave?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:Yeah. Silver door about halfway through the room on your way. It's about 600 feet away.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: I hit faster if I'm a cat?
**DM**:  You actually do. You've got 60 foot of movement as a cat.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Minus 20 feet for exhaustion.
**DM**: It is For first level of exhaustion? Minus five. Minus five feet for first level.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: New bonus action dash, but I will play a cat for this. 
**DM**: You need your bonus action to transform into a cat, but it'll make you faster in future rooms.
**DM**: And the cat,
**DM**: You all see [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], like, turn into cat and start sprinting towards this door. And then And do it again. Oh, you get, level plus constitution.
**DM**: Right. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]], you are up because I rolled your initiative and you rolled well.
**DM**: What would you like to do?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Let's see.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: This could work. Alright. I'm going to cast haste.
**DM**: On yourself.
**DM**: Okay. So your movement speed is doubled.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: That means 80 feet of movement.
**DM**: Haste is your action to cast. Yeah. So no dashing this time, but next time you can dash again.
**DM**: Yeah. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]], that is 80 feet of movement. Are you just sprinting to that door?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Going about five miles an hour.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Yeah. I know. It's it's it's kinda weird, the movement in DND.
**DM**: But it it you're traveling 80 feet in six seconds.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: You said rounds were 10.
**DM**: Yeah. Yeah. But, like, call DND this.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: I thought, oh, rounds rounds are, like, six seconds.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: No. But court had said
**DM**: I'm in core yeah. In core d and d, there's six, but I feel like that's slightly too quick for what all happens in a round. But in core d and d, you're moving 80 feet in six seconds, which is pretty speedy when you've also already spent three of your seconds going hamina hamina hamina to get fast.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Technically do the six, I got to do it.
**DM**: Were you a cat? Because you can't speak.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: So, yeah, it's just like, it's just, like, really fast.
**DM**: And each has a verbal component.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Yeah. There he's just like, meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow. And then bam.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Meow.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: It's just got getting the zoomies.
**DM**: Yeah. Presumably, some That's just After after [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]], something else happens.
**DM**: But none of you are near that, so none of you notice.
**DM**: So, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]] sorry. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]].
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: So here's a my re implant speech, would I know inherently what it does?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Cool. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]] just like I don't know how she would go about I think she would speak out loud and just go, we're not here to hurt you and cast Druidcraft.
**DM**: It's okay.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: To create just a lovely breeze for the plants.
**DM**: Can I get so usually, I'd give I'd let the Druidcraft give you advantage, but [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] has also murdered some of these plants? I'm so sorry. So can I get a persuasion check on a straight roll?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: The DC would be higher than taking five because I have a plus 13.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I'm just gonna roll it because I want to.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: 23.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I'm on [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]]. Heck yeah.
**DM**: 23. How far does this like let you do?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: It says
**DM**: Within 30 feet. Right?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Yeah. Plants or plant creatures within 30 feet of you share a common language.
**DM**: So while while if anyone is in within 30 feet of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|evergreen]], the plants will not attack.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Stay near [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]].
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: So I used my action to cast root craft.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: And then there's just this lovely nice breeze going around trying to, like, make [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] feel good.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: And then Illinois, mister Krabs.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Mhmm. Do you feel good now? Are you feeling it, mister Crab? 
**DM**:Hush. Are you gonna stop moving?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: And then I'm just gonna slow I'm not gonna run, but I am going to move, like, 10 feet.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Are you feeling it now, mister Krabs?
**DM**: Okay. You have 590 feet to go. I've agreed.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I have plants, but I can only do so much in one turn.
**DM**: Okay. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]].
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Yes. Where am I in this room? Am I anywhere near [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|evergreen]]?
**DM**: You are right next to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]].
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Alright.
**DM**: Is it horse time? I feel like it's horse time.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Evergreen wants to talk to the place.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: It's horse time. I'm gonna I'm going to, I'm gonna blah blah blah blah. Where's my smells? I'm going to find Steve. Use my,
**DM**: Swear I need to have the same brain because some of my brain said forms as well.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Use my fine steed and then turn to evergreen and say, can you ask [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] to clear a path? I don't want to step on [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]].
**DM**: Speaking is yeah. Speaking is a free action, but making persuasion check isn't. So
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: In my next turn. Yes. Yeah. On my next turn, I can.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Yeah. Standing beside evergreen with my haunts.
**DM**: Okay. So then are you just gonna go stand beside Evergreen with your horse? With with like your horse is probably like this large, like, liquid metal mount.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Yes.
**DM**: It it has, like, almost steam vent out of the top of it, and it's glowing with that same energy that's in your call.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I like to imagine it can, like, shape shift into, like, different forms. Like, it can only pick one form per fine steed, but depending on the situation.
**DM**: Yeah. So this one probably almost has, like, very light very, like, narrow hooves.
**DM**: Like, to minimize stoppage.
**DM**: It just stands there. Top of the round, Maria [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], can I get dexterity saving for us?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: I have advantage on those now.
**DM**: Uh-huh. 
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:That's what I think. 31.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: That's brilliant.
**DM**: Yeah. Yeah. They try. It's almost comical. So, like, some of these reeds of wheat try to grab you by the legs as you're a cat and you just go oing. Like, you know the vertical jump that cats do? Yep. Just oing.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Oh, thank fuck. Alright. 21.
**DM**: Yeah. Maria, it's probably less, they don't grab you, but you are just not where they think you should be. You're moving faster than someone in about half a ton of armor should.
**DM**: Yeah.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: That's gotta be some kinda existential dread that, like, space marines got going on. I was like, no one that big each in that amount of weight should be moving that fast.
**DM**: Yeah. With with a fucking buster sword, like, like, probably in your hands at this point.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Oh, yeah. I'm just it's in one hand that I'm just dashing with it, and I'm I'm look look like, I'm looking like Cloud running with his sword.
**DM**: Honestly, this part is amazing.
**DM**: Can't wait for you guys to trip up a locked doll later. Top of that, right, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], what would you like to do?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Zoom. 
**DM**:Is it zoom east? So that is you've now moved 220 feet because it's movement action bonus action if you're only moving.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Why?
**DM**: So [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] dash is a bonus action, and as a cat, they have 55 feet of movement.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Jeez.
**DM**: Hey. So that is so they moved their first turn after turning into a cat.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Bros. Naruto running.
**DM**: It's a as a as a, like, a tiny little panther. I also don't think tiny. I think, like, a normal sized panther, just, like, zooming.
**DM**: Yeah. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], you are about 80 feet from the end of the, week.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: See if it's going not 15 miles per hour, by the way.
**DM**: Yeah. Uh-huh. You're you're moving 15 miles per hour of.
**DM**: Eight feet, you said? Uh-huh. Eight feet away from the end of the Eight 80 feet away from the end of the week. Maria?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Oh, yeah. I'm here. I'm sorry. I had to down my headphones for a second. What's
**DM**: We we gotta we gotta be sprinting at Jogo.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Yeah. Time to dash.
**DM**: So 80 fee, 160. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], you see Maria pass you, like, as a blur of metal.
**DM**: And in your mind, just very briefly, nothing that big should move that fast.
**DM**: Like, this is this is very clearly magical.
**DM**: That Otter saying that? Or No. No? No. This is just something you think for a second. You've never seen Maria move anywhere near this quickly.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: That's some trans that's some transhuman dread going on right there.
**DM**: Yeah. You see [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] not even noticing [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] near you to being in front of you in six seconds. As a note rainbow, that's 160 feet.
**DM**: Evergreen, what are we doing?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Evergreen? She's not gonna talk. She's gonna keep doing the, DruidCraft to just make it feel nice for the plants around her. She's a farmer at heart. Like, come on. And she just goes, I won't hurt you. Can you make a path for us so we can get to the core?
**DM**: Persuasion check with advantage this time because no one has murdered plants since last time.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Evergreen right now is just the meme. This is fine.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: This is fine.
**DM**: 21. You see as some of the stocks, like, bend to the sides, you will probably trample a few of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] but not many. And they seem to be happy with this sacrifice.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Hurry out of initiative.
**DM**: You've only made friends of the week.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Ready to do that three more times.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Fair. Does wanna talk to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]], but no worries. I can count on that.
**DM**: Only one more time, actually. You only need to get halfway through this room.
**DM**: You not gonna hop on the horse?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Evergreen will go her full movement this time, but trying to move fully, she doesn't know. Evergreen wants to walk through a field like her childhood. Like, right now, she is, like, fully happy because this is
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: What la la land?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Evergreen was born on a fucking farm.
**DM**: Well, Evergreen is now in Evergreen is now in any danger. It's the thing.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Ever literally, Evergreen is just wants to make friends with [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]].
**DM**: Like, these plants were mildly sentient before evergreen got near [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]].
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: They can communicate with me telepathically, by the way.
**DM**: They don't actually say anything because their intelligence is still 3.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Uh-huh.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Not very smart plants.
**DM**: They're dumber than Buddy, and that's a feat. 
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:That's possible? *
**DM**:Yeah.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Do they at least show that the wind feels nice?
**DM**: They do seem to be dancing in a bit, and you actually see a few seeds fall off some of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] through, like, of the grains. Yeah. You can pick [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] up.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: How many do I get?
**DM**: I'll let you know in a second. Then what are you doing?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I'm going to attempt with my with my needle fit foot horse stance, to walk carefully through the, the wheat.
**DM**: If if you only move and do not dash, you will not trample many.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Okay. I will only move, which, I'm guessing let me look at my my haunts'
**DM**: Yeah. You get 25 seeds, like grains of corn.
**DM**: And please mark that under awakened call.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Cor? I thought it was wheat.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Oh, I'm guessing
**DM**: Oh, yeah. We sorry. Same thing.
**DM**: A grain plant.
**DM**: Give me a moment.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I'm trying to find my here we go. Okay. There's no information about it. Oops. I just I'm guessing it's just my walk speed, so 30 feet.
**DM**: No. It's the riding horse. It is. Where is fine steed?
**DM**: Feinstein. It does actually only spell it has a thing.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Okay. Hold on. Let me look.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: 60 feet. Alright. I will move 60 feet.
**DM**: 60 feet for another world. For another world, Lucy. Oh, oh, is it a fee, a celestial, or a feed? You get to choose this when it appears.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I I'm thinking celestial because I don't know if if Fae would work well in a vault.
**DM**: Faye Faye gives you, like, a teleportation of 60 feet once per one rest of horse. Celestial gives you actually regate. You can give someone, two d six plus two sorry, two d eight plus two health back if they're within five feet of the horse. You can actually heal someone a bit with the horse, and the fiend one, I'm assuming you are not picking.
**DM**: It's just one of those two things.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: No. I'm Alright. I'll go with the Faye one then because I don't wanna trample anything, so teleportation would be best.
**DM**: Would you like to use the teleportation this turn as well? Cool. So you move a 20 feet this turn without trampling anything.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Yay. Alright.
**DM**: You're about halfway through you're just over halfway through this field. So is that now behind? Top no. You're still ahead of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]. But you do you do see this horse just appear maybe 50 feet behind you with [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] on top of it. Although I wouldn't see it every time. Well, yeah.
**DM**: The top of the round, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]], you took real good care not to hurt any plants.
**DM**: Maria and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]. Thanks. Dexterity saving for us.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Alrighty.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I got Maria into [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]].
**DM**:  Maria, you could use strength if you wanted instead. Oh, dear.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: I might But do I but do I get but do I get advantage on it? I probably not.
**DM**: You would not get advantage on it from the haste, but your strength save is probably quite a bit higher. I might talk about that. I think
**DM**: Yep. 18 is
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Well, thank God because I got an 18 on it. We lost 28.
**DM**: Eight year on its own would have been a success.
**DM**: How close to Maria is ahead of you. No. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:That's a 14.
**DM**: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], you are grappled and restrained.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Not again.
**DM**: You also take I don't know. I never actually thought I'd get to roll this on [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]].
**DM**: Take three points of damage. Okay. The we is
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Three points of damage as you notice that your clothes are starting to get ripped off of you.
**DM**: Yeah. Like The bar is all they're laughing. Very hard in your brain. Oh, that was Very, very hard. Oh, again. Not again.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Hey, Nel.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I like how you have the dynamic of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] and Maria, like, absolutely, like, having deck saves left, right, and center. Then you have Evergreen that's just slowly trying to make sure she doesn't crush as many as possible.
**DM**: I'd like, also [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] like on a giant metal war hole, but taking extreme care just to move nice and slowly through the field.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I don't wanna hurt nobody. I don't wanna hurt nobody. Anyway.
**DM**: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] Yes? You may use your action to attempt to break free. You can use athletics or acrobatics. 
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Acrobatics, please.
**DM**: Okay. Remember minus two.
**DM**: You're fine. 21 is fine. You do break through, but that is your action.
**DM**: It sprinting time?
**DM**: You don't know the people behind you are managing to not get attacked.
**DM**: I can't look into that. You are still a cat. 
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:I'm fast too. 
**DM**:And Mhmm. You can rub. You can use your claws.
**DM**: Yeah. We're all Cool. That is you are now at 330. You are about 30 feet into these, and it is a long it is a wide field of what what looks like a mix of potatoes and other tube like, tuber plants and some carrots and things like that in this root vegetable field. 
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:Can you see if there's, like, any sort of, like, abnormalities while he's running, like, with the vegetables [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]selves? He seems to be moving slightly. Specifically, some of the anything wrong with 
**DM**:No. Except that some of the root vegetables seem like they're expanding as you get closer to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]. 
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Specifically mean? 
**DM**:As you get close to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]. Yes. Maria.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Far left do they have to go?
**DM**: That is another 160. Maria has 200 feet left.
**DM**: And at the end at the end of Maria's term, the second, room effect happens because you are in the tubers now.
**DM**: The two people in the two people in the root vegetables, so this is Maria and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], can you make me constitution saving froze, please, as the nearest plant next to you explode in a noxious fume?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: How's the 17?
**DM**: Not 20 for a 22. 20 two, 17, you're both fine. You feel actually, I don't think you're immune to poison, Maria, like being poisoned anymore.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: No. I'm only resistant to fire, necrotic, psychic, and radiant.
**DM**: Yeah. So but you can feel this poison trying to empty your system. You've had worse you've had worse vegetables for breakfast?
**DM**: Remember that one time back home where one of the fay replaced your fertilizer with literal poison as a joke?
**DM**: You were on the toilet for weeks?
**DM**: This was the this is the one year is bad.
**DM**: It's surprisingly similar. It's a similar vibe.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Oh, great.
**DM**: Anywhere. Evergreen.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Is keeping up the wind as much as she can because it's a fucking cantrip, and it has a range of 30 feet.
**DM**: Uh-huh. So Evergreen is still 530 feet away, assuming Evergreen moves the foot. Yeah.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: She is moving the max of her movement because I can't dash in anything, but I want to I as she moves, she's taking if she steps on, she apologizes and keeps going.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: She feels awful.
**DM**: Yeah. To be fair, when when everyone else gets to the door, I'm just going to have evergreen to show up after a minute or so because evergreen is under no danger from at least from the assuming you pass the check with the root vegetables.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Yeah. Evergreen at one point will in as she's walking in this round, she'll probably just go, do you think you can carry me to the door? And she points to the silver door.
**DM**: Persuasion check with disadvantage because you're asking [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] to do something for you.
**DM**: And they do not under they do not understand the concept of carrying. But, oh, well, you have a you have a silver tongue.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Hey. It's better than the natty 20 I rolled.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Was a 20 which was a 33 in total. So 20.
**DM**: Oh, yeah. Yeah. At the top of the round, the plants will aid you instead of hurting you.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I am going to make, attempt to make another move towards the door.
**DM**: So is it just, u dashing?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: No. I'm gonna do the what I did last time.
**DM**: Yep. You are completely fine.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Everyone's fighting for their fucking lives.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: An evergreen is like,
**DM**: Of the ground, the top of the ground, evergreen. Some of the plants reach out to grab you. What do you do?
**DM**: Yeah. You will move 40 feet.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: What does this look like to everyone else?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: She's having the time of her life.
**DM**: No one else sees this because you're so far behind. And, Evergreen, these plants are taller these plants are taller than you as well.
**DM**: These are like fall foot tall corn stalks.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Yeah. She's having the time of her life.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I please want [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] or Maria to hit the door.
**DM**: They're, like, very gentle as well. That's It's Your go. 
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:Just continuing to move.
**DM**: That's another, 165 feet for you. So fifty five fifty five fifty five.
**DM**: I thought it was before then. You are pretty fucking close.
**DM**: Will get the next range. You're 400 you're 105 feet away from it. Okay. Maria.
**DM**: No. You're 200 feet away. Next, if you move dash, you'll be 40 feet.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Yes. I'm only, what, 40 feet away from the door now? Okay. Well, I'm about to dash.
**DM**: Yep. So you are now 40 feet away, and you see maybe about actually, only about 20 feet away from you, there's this long steel pathway.
**DM**: That seems to be in between the root vegetables and the, grapevines just up ahead.
**DM**: You don't need to go into the Great Plains, but they are ahead of you.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: So the path doesn't lead anywhere down.
**DM**: The path leads to the silver door and then straight across the room to the other door on the other side.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Door are we going across? I mean,
**DM**: Are going to the silver one.
**DM**: Right. You were getting there next round. But for the final time, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] and Maria, can I get a constitution saving through?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Alrighty. Oh, nice. 21.
**DM**: 21. Coped it. So, 14. 14. you are poisoned. You have the poisoned condition.
**DM**: You also take an amount of poison damage that is halved, I believe. As you as as you feel this poison roll over you, your armor, the mercury scales on your armor less slightly. You would take 11. You take five.
**DM**: One of these tubers just goes bang next to you. It looks like it was a pumpkin. Not anymore. Was a pumpkin. Yes. Right.
**DM**: You two no longer need to do anything. Yeah. You two are at the door.
**DM**: Maria and because your next turn, there's nothing gonna happen before your next turn, so you two can make it to the door before anything else happens.
**DM**: I'll come back to you guys to to see what you're doing on your terms, though. Evergreen. What we doing?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Can I ask [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] for any [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Owl of knowladge\|knowledge]] about anything that's happened recently to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]?
**DM**: Billy, you hear in your voice, big silver man passes through sometimes. Water starts at night.
**DM**: Sun goes up, sun goes down, water starts. Sun goes up, sun goes down, water starts. Sun goes up, sun goes down, water starts. Sun goes up, sun goes down, metal man appears, water starts.
**DM**: This continues for as far back as you can learn.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: So every couple of days, every couple of days, he comes by. Evergreen is hoping that they, like, help her move faster because she only has 30 feet of movement, and she is actively still keeping up the fucking breeze. She can barely see shit. She doesn't know where the fuck she's going.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: She's just hoping that they help guide her to the door.
**DM**: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Ah, yes. I am going to continue to move, but I'm guessing I'm down with the potatoes.
**DM**: You you make it directly to the potatoes.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Oh, lovely. Luckily, I am
**DM**: Top of the round, Evergreen, you move another 40 feet. You're now a hundred feet away from potatoes because Evergreen is moving at the La La Land pace.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I'm moving my full 30 feet. Thank you very much.
**DM**: Uh-huh. And then they move you an additional 40.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Yes.
**DM**: You do not, but, however, you are not like [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] and Maria. You cannot go at sonic speed.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I think it's something phone one of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] hits the wall.
**DM**: No. Because they are in, like, they're in very good control of their movement. Like, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] is a cat and could just bounce off the wall. Like, do paws up, bounce off. And for Maria, it's not that Maria's moving faster, I think. It's that everyone else seems to be moving slower, like, in Maria's perception.
**DM**: Like it's, everything just gets slowed down to like half speed.
**DM**: You're watching the YouTube video at point five speed because you're a weirdo.
**DM**: But, yeah, top of the round. One of you is out of the we the other the other one, the we loves you. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], I'm assuming you're going to the door.
**DM**: Yes. You're going to the door and Not touching the door. Getting back into human? Very specifically, not touching the door. Fuck you. Okay. Good good plan.
**DM**: These you get to the door. Mhmm.
**DM**: And I'm assuming you're just going to wait.
**DM**: For your friends.
**DM**: Look back, you see [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] on their metal house. You see Maria moving at the speed of a small it's like the speed of you, which is extremely unnerving when they're wearing that much metal.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: You cannot see Evergreen.
**DM**: You cannot see Evergreen. But, like, maybe a hundred feet behind [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]], you see, like, rustling.
**DM**: No. It's not your dad. He's installed on. 
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:How much how much do I take? 
**DM**: Nothing. You have the poisoned condition. So go into your conditions where you've got exhaustion. Yeah.
**DM**: You do not know how long you are pointing for.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: I use the scroll? 
**DM**:Would you like to use the scroll on your poison condition? 
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:I can only do it on one.
**DM**: Yeah. Does it not get rid of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] both? 
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:No. It get rid it gets rid of what? 
**DM**:Oh, no. No damage. Yeah. No. It's all I don't know. It's not. 
**DM**:It's you get rid of a single negative effect on you.
**DM**: For greater restoration.
**DM**: Great restoration. I don't know. It has changed recently because it's the new one. So remove one of the following effects.
**DM**: Low exhaustion. I'll say you can remove your poison with it. If you're spending your scroll, I'll say you can remove your poison as well.
**DM**: There not be,
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: So in, like, Poisson's kit, would there be antidotes? 
**DM**:No. Antidote is a separate item. 
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:Okay. Okay.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: I am actually going to hold my action instead.
**DM**: Going to sell orders off last. I get back. Okay. What are you holding your actions to? 
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:I don't know. 
**DM**:Yes. Okay. I'll come back to you. Maria.
**DM**: Assuming you're just gonna get out of the mode of potatoes.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Hi. Oh, yeah. And, Marie is in a trance right now. She's got, like, tunnel vision. She's got she's got a mission of her own.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: And you would see her touch the silver door at at a at a full sprint still.
**DM**: Maria and Ash, could I get you in the shadow realm? And Asher, sorry. Can I get you both in the shadow realm, please?
**DM**: No. You don't have to leave. Just don't react.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Atticus. I cannot wait to see who Ash is playing.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: There we go. I like how you have evergreen that's constantly being like, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to step on you. Like, she's
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Then you have Maria and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] that are like,
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: They tried to attack us and everybody's just like, guys, we're in their home.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Yeah. Exactly.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: You would attack someone that invaded your home too.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: At least I learned now that [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]] comes every couple of days.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Is interesting.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Because [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]] came recently from what the plant said, which means we've got, like, two or three days before [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]] comes to the field again.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Also with Druidcraft, I can make the effect the smell of a skunk.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Like, Jared Craft is so fucking cool. Like, hold on. Let me task court if I can, like, grow the favor using it.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: This is what Jerico has.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Like, I gotta predict the weather for, the outside world in the next twenty four hours.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Is playing child of the corn right now.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: By the way, we're having rat races on the first, element. Right?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Like, the rat races I had planned for the one shot we're doing in the element, which I'm happy about.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Yeah. Oh, yes. I'm talking with Asher about Asher possibly playing one of my NPCs because they they really wanna play a deer shifter, and I have a deer shifter as one of my NPCs. But they would be mute.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: So I'm probably going to have to learn, like, Breckin sign language. I gotta go run to the bathroom real quick.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I'm gonna send you something. Actually, I'm gonna put it in VC text because I want everyone else to be cursed with this image.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Oh my god. I hate that.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Imagine what a reversed Medusa would look like.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Yeah. Yes.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Hey, Calypso. Oh, God. I hate that. Hold on. I'm working on something. Do you want to hear it?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Okay. Let me, let me export it and I'll send it to you. It is still very much a work in progress.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: It's taking five ever.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Hopefully, I can send it to you before they come back in.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Asher might be nonverbal right now.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Namely man boy in vertical head shaking.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Kind of a cipher this.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Family man, boy. Come on.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: What could fur what could, family man boy mean? No. Hover over the VC text emoji. It's family man boy.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: What? No. Wrong.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I'm a concern for my father. Yes. Please save him, maybe?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Possibly.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I bought one.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Look at
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Oh my god.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Oh, road of toads. I trode the toad road.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I walk a lonely toad, the only one I have ever known. Don't know why it croaks, but so so to me. Oh, we've got family man boy again.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: So my dad. Yes. Wave. Thank you. Or please.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: You're all helping him. I'm in the British car whirlpool. Help him in the British world car whirlpool.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Waving. Thank you again.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I'm scared now.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Help. I'm in the British car Whirlpool.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: It's just a roundabout.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: That's the funny part. It's a car whirlpool.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Now I know Britain does it weird sometimes, but you haven't seen the one that goes around that one monument. Not not the Eiffel Tower, but the one monument in, in France. It's like the Victory Archway.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I know. I I've seen photos of it.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Yeah. And imagine an American trying to drive in that shit. I have seen so many car wrecks of Americans trying to do roundabouts that are just the single lane ones, and dear Jesus.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Yay. Nathan's gonna help me with my song.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Nice.

**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Sorry. Give me a minute. I had to just take my meds. Give me a minute.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I I don't know. I I don't know.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I I don't know.
**DM**: You need a minute dialing?
**DM**: Yeah. Well, at this point, I would like Asha and Maria to join me in the shadow realm.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: You need a hug, Rainbow?
**DM**: Hello. So, Rainbow, how are you going to try and unlock this bolt?
**DM**: You okay? Coughing?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: They don't know. I I I genuinely don't know how I would open it.
**DM**: So slight of hand to try and, like, just jimmy the lock.
**DM**: Oh. We'd ask [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Beth Baine\|Beth]] to open it for you. Oh, like athletics to try and break the lock or some sort of magic to try and destroy the lock.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: That requires me using a spell slot. I don't have many.
**DM**: Not necessarily. What can trips do you have?
**DM**: Do any of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] deal damage?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: None that are useful. I have Druidcraft guidance.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I I have Vicious Monastery.
**DM**: Don't think it'll be insulted. What are your other ones?
**DM**: Sacred Flame does do damage.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Spare the dying sacred flame guidance into witchcraft.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Needs to roll dexterity then.
**DM**: It fails. It's an inanimate lock.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Only five damage.
**DM**: It does actually break it. This is a simple lock.
**DM**: Let's see what you get because you got the good box.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: My throat hurts.
**DM**: Oh, Jesus.
**DM**: You you get two things in here.
**DM**: You get a, something you're probably not going to be able to use and something you are.
**DM**: So you get a plate armor of invulnerability.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Hold on. Let me find that. Vulnerability?
**DM**: Invulnerability, not vulnerability.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I only see vulnerability.
**DM**: One moment. Let me check if this is still an item in the game.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Can close my sheet if you need.
**DM**: Armor of invulnerability.
**DM**: And it should be plate. Should be able to get it as plate. Okay.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Fleet, heavy armor, and vulnerability.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Okay. Back to my looting bag. Okay.
**DM**: And this is the best roll I've ever seen on this. 4,446 gold's worth of gems.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Jesus.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Can you can you type that for me, please?
**DM**: Yeah. No worries. In VC tech, this is the best rule I've ever seen on my random loop generator.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: So adding that to gold or where am I adding? Okay.
**DM**: Just the goal. Just the goal. These are, like, one for one transferrable, basically.
**DM**: You all see you all see, like, Evergreen pull out this giant set of plate mail that looks extremely well made.
**DM**: And then just pull out gemstone after gemstone from underneath it.
**DM**: Like, looking like Your your small handful of gems Mhmm. Like, there are four times that many in there. You watch every you just pull out and put in a bag.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Was muted, sad face.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Don't I don't think anyone could technically wear this.
**DM**: I mean, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] do know [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] can't because the chassis is their armor.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Because it's heavy armor.
**DM**: Maria both of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] and Maria can.
**DM**: Yeah. Put it in the bag for now.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Maria is nowhere to be found, so evergreen, she's gonna chalk it up to selling it. She's selling it.
**DM**: Can have that conversation when you're not in the vault. So the three of you notice Maria isn't here as you finish looting this room.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Where did she run off to?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Where's the where's the map leading me?
**DM**: The map is leading you forward.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Evergreen points to the door and says we gotta go that way.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: We don't have much time.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Is the doo made of? 
**DM**:It's like a wooden doll, but when you open it, it's that black material, and Maria left it open.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Wait. What time is it?
**DM**: It is about it's not been that long. You've maybe been in here for, like, five minutes loading.
**DM**: And then about five minute you you've only spent about ten minutes today, give or take.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: That I'm saying we don't have much time. Evergreen just says it's only, like, 08:45.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: That's true, but
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Only been in here for a couple of hours.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: We should we should still get moving forward.
**DM**: So you all go for the stall? Do I see anything else?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I go to the door that the core is pointing at. I go to I don't push on it, but I go to it and say, this is the door that the core is towards.
**DM**: Yeah. So, that does anyone go into it?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I probably would.
**DM**: Okay. So you go into this room, and it is a large you first thing you notice actually is it it's cold in this room.
**DM**: It's, like, probably about two degrees Celsius, so it's just above freezing.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Wow. It's cold in here.
**DM**: And in the stent, is a giant test tube.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Just for context, that is hold on. It's 30 That's 35 Fahrenheit.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: There anything in the test tube?
**DM**: Like, a giant, and you see a vaguely humanoid mass floating in it.
**DM**: There are there are panels and wires around. You cannot tell if it's alive.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Is it conscious? 
**DM**:You cannot tell that.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:I'm asking because I need to know if I can sense the feelings or not.
**DM**: You do not sense anything.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Evergreen goes to the panels.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Asks [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Owl of knowladge\|knowledge]]. What the fuck does any of this say?
**DM**: It is in it is it is actually in Void speech.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Oh.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I'm still a fox. I'm in my fox fort. I could've fucking flown.
**DM**: Oh, Jesus. Yeah.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I could've fucking flown 60 feet.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I know. I forgot it was in Fox.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: What does it say?
**DM**: Oh, no. Yeah. You could've just flew and you could've flew up as well and just not been re oh, no. Don't do that. Boys feet. Okay? Uh-huh. Don't dare. It's what your what your Latin education gets you these days. There is a there were, like, there are lots of buttons that say lots of things. One of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] says terminate. These are the important ones. One says terminate experiment. One says release. One says defrost. And one says incinerate.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: It's not like an about me book.
**DM**: No. There is not an about me button.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Or, like, a note. Is there any, like, notes or anything?
**DM**: There are no there are actually no notes in this room.
**DM**: It's quite barren, honestly.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Is this the only test tube in the room?
**DM**: Yes. The it is giant as well. It is like this humanoid figure in it is maybe, like, 20 feet tall.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: It look like [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Buddy\|Buddy]]?
**DM**: Vaguely. It's got it's got similar
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Hold on. I'm doing now. Oh.
**DM**: It's got similar proportions to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Buddy\|buddy]].
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: We want a friend?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Any of the buttons look like they've been used, like, multiple times before?
**DM**: That is an investigation check.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Oh, balls. 
**DM**:That is an investigation check because you're looking for minute wear and tear.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Nope.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: All of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] is investigating the bugs. Can I investigate the test tube, baby?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Kick the baby.
**DM**: Okay. Looking at the test tube, the 20 foot tall test tube, baby. As you get closer, like, you wipe some of the frost from the outside of the test tube. And looking at it, it look it does look a little bit like [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Buddy\|Buddy]], but weirder.
**DM**: Like, you see these its skin is red. It has horns coming out of the top of its head.
**DM**: You're not certain? It could look like a devil, but it also could look it could be like a devil or it could be a demon as the base.
**DM**: Oh, coughing. You're good? Then what are you doing with the test tube, baby?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I am going to, like, investigate it and ask [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Ava\|Ava]] if she knows what it could possibly be.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I think I've seen one of these before.
**DM**: Is a century. It is a century. We have met two in our time. Three, actually.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Yeah. I I recognized it. Why does it look so different?
**DM**: This is not an approved project.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I might know who's behind it.
**DM**: Like, there are, like, panels that are, like, completely dark, like, around it that look like they could have been monitoring it, but they're completely dark. No power, no nothing. And
**DM**: And for you, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], you can tell what button has never been pressed with that set. Release. Release has never been pressed. You could tell because it still is the case over the top of it. In theory, because it's could potentially be a demon. Mhmm. What check would I have to make to see if I knew what it was? Religion or arcana. Anyone can make this, by the way.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I do the same religion or arcana?
**DM**: Yep. Name you get advantage.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I got a 21, but I can roll again.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I'm gonna roll religion.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Oh, 22. Okay.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: 16 for religion.
**DM**: Nope.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: 20.
**DM**: You removed your exhaustion. Use the scroll.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Pointed.
**DM**: The scroll hit both.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Oh, yeah. The sixteen natty. 16 for religion.
**DM**: Then what was your 20 on?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: 20 two. It was on arc Arcana.
**DM**: Yours was? 20 Arkana. Nope.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Take a wild guess who rolled that.
**DM**: For the religion on 16, this thing this reminds you of a creature you have seen in your dreams.
**DM**: It has very similar, like, coloration of the skin. The horns move in a very like, are angled in a very familiar way.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: The most recent dreams.
**DM**: You can almost see that red pulsing in the veins. Yes.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Okay. That's not concerning.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: An easier way to answer this question. Are my eyes white right now. No.
**DM**: That doesn't happen all the time, only when you're under threat.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Does it not?
**DM**: No.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Oh.
**DM**: Doesn't just happen when you're near a demon. You're not, an Elven blade from Lord of the Rings.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: I do not understand that reference.
**DM**: Okay. For [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], this looks like [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Buddy\|Buddy]]. This is the same type of creature as [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Buddy\|Buddy]], but it is this is new as well. This has not been here for more than a month.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I would turn to the
**DM**: Is no dust in this room, and it is definitely demonic.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I I have I will turn to the group and say, this is a century. It's much like [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Buddy\|Buddy]], but it's been
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Mutated? It it has demonic properties. It might be dangerous if we can't seem to sway it to our side.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I have to roll for [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the White/Vengence\|vengeance]]?
**DM**: No, because it's not hurt you.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Well, no. Because of its relation.
**DM**: No. No. You're all good.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: If we could wake it and persuade it to on our side, but I don't know if that's possible.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I will not even attempt.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: I ask [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the White/Honor\|Honor]] what he thinks of it? 
**DM**:Eliminate.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Lovely.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: I figured you'd say that.
**DM**: Incinerate.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:Only burn it if I put a seed and walnut to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the White/Honor\|Honor]].
**DM**: Oh, no. You feel you feel [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the White/Honor\|Honor]] jester towards the panel.
**DM**: Everyone else, one of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]'s arms moves very weirdly towards the panel.
**DM**: I don't find stopping doing this. Although he doesn't press it, he just think it was like that. They just gestures arm wildly towards panel.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Is [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]o right?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Oh, no. My hand is moving on its own court. Someone's sending you a message.
**DM**: But, yeah, fifth seems fine. What are you free doing with this information?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Grappling on whether we should incinerate it or not because this is a living creature.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: And even though it's dangerous, it's not its fault that it's dangerous.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I would feel very bad harming a century, just like I felt very bad harming an elder brain.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: The brain is, like, dissociating, staring at it for a minute.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I would ask [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Ava\|Ava]] if incinerating is the only option.
**DM**: We can terminate test.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Yes. But it's a living being.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Maybe killing it would be a mercy.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: You speaking out loud then to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Ava\|Ava]]?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: How evergreen moves towards the incinerate button. Like, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/The True End (The Grey)\|the gray]] tails, the ears are wildly shifting and flicking very angrily, and she just impresses the incinerate button.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Without a hesitation.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: That happens, then I'm just sort of sighs, but not not in a, in, like, a upset way, but, like, in a relieved way.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Yeah. So air quote evergreen presses it.
**DM**: You watch as they as the entire test tube just immolates from the inside. It doesn't break open, but just fire and fire hotter than you have ever felt. You can feel this through the glass. The room raises temperature to maybe 20 degrees Celsius in an instant.
**DM**: And then it's gone, and there is nothing but ash in this test tube.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] just sort of, like, laces his hand on the test tube and says, I'm sorry.
**DM**: I don't have that. That's my other card.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Sorry, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]. I had to.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Fine. I was wanting to
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Which way is the map leading us now?
**DM**: So you've got two exits from this room, and for the first time, the map isn't actually leading you either direction.
**DM**: It has an arrow pointing both ways. There is one straight forward and one to the left.
**DM**: You are not allowed to answer that. You are not allowed to input on this because you've heard where Maria went.
**DM**: Okay. You have heard where Maria went, so you were not allowed to answer this.
**DM**: Would you guys like to go?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Need to flip we need to find Maria. Which way do you think she would have gone?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: This point, we could go up and end up down. I have no idea where she is. Actually, I could ask, but then we would have to ask it for the core again. This is uncommon.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I might I might ask you to do that.
**DM**: Your map doesn't have a living.
**DM**: Map doesn't seem to have a limit on how many times you can use it.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: The issue would be if Maria's going the wrong way to the core. But it it it's giving both doors. So there's possibly a way down in both sides.
**DM**: Where does the map say that [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Luna\|Luna]]'s, You're on the Fourth Floor, you don't know. That would be an inquiry to question to ask Evergreen.
**DM**: I might cover up for that.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Court realizes they have to roll for something.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Sometimes I wonder at this point, how thick the talus is on my big toe are, and I wonder how much is actually left.

**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: One looks like it's been entered more?
**DM**: They are just wooden door. No. Actually, they are both silver. They are both silver. Unclear.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Is there any wear and tear on the floor that shows directions?

**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: No. That's what I'm asking. It's going towards the left door.
**DM**: It was left up.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Trust your judgment on this.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I say we follow the footsteps, and I'll try to if I listen. Since I say we follow the footsteps, because according to the plants, the big silver man fa comes every couple of days to water the plants out there.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: That's true.

**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: This monstrosity.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Goddamn it.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Oh, I fixed the reunited art, so it's no longer cursed.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Yes. Look.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Oh my god. I love that. See, it's not hungry, Chris.

**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: It's from Walmart. It's only, like, $10. Not not even $10. It's a dryer wreck book. Look at that.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Oh my god.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I want to get that just to troll K.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: My god. You can put it on the back of your phone.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Oh, no. Oh, no. That's awful.

**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I found old art I drew of evergreen.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I I want it. I want it so bad.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Yeah, that would be so awesome. Just like a little toe drying wrap.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I I would buy it just to put it in Armory's apartment.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Tied around the house. There's every
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: No. Yeah. I I I would.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: It's like Asher and the rubber dots just like hide [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] all over the place. Every time Amory comes in, it's in a different place.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: We found the toes.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Oh, no. The chissey.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Kay's oh, no. Kay's mom and, his aunt used to have a thing like that where they would every time they would come oh my god. Every time they would come over, they would hide a gnome somewhere in the house.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: And then, like, when when you found it, you had to hide it in their house for the next time. So every once in a while, they would just find a gnome randomly in the shower or staring at you from behind the toilet.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Mhmm. Evergreen now, by the way, has, like, 50 something seeds from the awaken, proteomics seeds, by the way.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Me like. Gonna make a fun little fun little garden.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I guess, let's just plant this garden here, Tal, and that'll go well.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Don't know. I might give some to Bobby Elena.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Because, like, it it seems like her type of deal. Not give her all of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]. Give her, like, some of each.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Okay. I'm gonna replace c.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Here here is your reminder to, import all of your Plurals pit. Thanks to simply if you haven't done that recently.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: You didn't know you could do that? Yeah. If you get your Plurals kit token, you can put that into simply plural, and it imports everything.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: It it makes keeping track so much easier. Oh, yeah. By the way, found out that evergreen can have tattoos.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Through [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Imagination\|Imagination]], she can give herself tattoos.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Dude, that's sick.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Now I'm looking for tattoo ideas.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I've sort of, I have no idea if it's, like, correct or not. It probably isn't, but I've created, like, a, like, a little design. I've been drawing it every time I draw [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], for the symbol of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Arbitration\|arbitration]].
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: It's, scales with a sword through it.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Mhmm. It's probably yeah. It's definitely not correct.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: They're different colors depending on the rank.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: The one I've been drawing looks kind of like a, like, a little bit like a dragon almost.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Found what the tattoo would look like that she would have.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Yay. Show me. Show me. Show me.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: So the tattoos actually can move, fun fact, and so it would be this. It's like it would swirl in, like, her chest, but the the rest of it would move all across her body.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: And only [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Foxie\|Foxy]] will ever see it. Just kidding.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I mean, everyone wears overalls. Like, I can't wait for you to meet my Alomac character, by the way, because she has scars from magic being used on her. If you want, you can look at the doc for it.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Please show me because I've I've already drawn, Armory's character.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: A while back.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I do not wish you to draw this because it you can if you want, but, this might be really complicated.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Will do my best.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: But, yeah, I will definitely attempt. And if it's too complicated
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Yeah. It's it's,
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: You're more than welcome to read the backstory as well if you want. I I really don't care. I worked really hard on it, and this isn't even all of it. It's missing the
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: That's exciting.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: It's missing something with it.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Okay. Let me look at this.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Oh.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: She is pretty. Okay. What's it missing?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: In just the backstory, it's missing
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Marietta has it. It just has the heart. Silvis, it's missing something with that. And I think it's,
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I think it's after the early early adult years, I think what she would have done is start up,
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: While working for VAR, a start up like a,
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Farm? Not a farm. A zoo in Tallinn and working with Vara and Tietjens. I think that's where it is, but I'm not % sure. Her symbol of Vara is the necklace, but she does have those, like, leaf things in her hair.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Yeah. If you look at all of her scars,
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Yeah. She she
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: She's wildly different than
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Then,
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: That's gonna be exciting to see you play. It's gonna be hard to play an antisocial character because Genesis is a bit antisocial.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: He would rather keep to himself.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Yeah. It's, it was mentioned in the early sessions, but it's a, it's like a medallion that has, like, a scale set of scales and then a sort through it.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Okay. I will definitely try to recreate that then.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: It's interesting. It's only been mentioned a few times, and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]s, I believe, is, like a mock version of silver. Not true silver because shifter, but, like, a mock version of it.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Like, it looks silver, at least.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Yeah. It it might be made of iron, but like treated iron, so it doesn't like rust.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Oh, this looks like an evergreen tattoo.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I don't know if she would have it.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: It looks like evergreen.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: It does, that's sick.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: If each eye could represent a part of a of the gray that she has in her connection to the oh my god. But where would she I feel like she would leg leg arm arm back. Okay. I need to roll a d six because I need to, like, wear that.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Why can't I okay. I'm gonna have to take a screenshot of this. Dang it.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Would be on her right arm.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: And it eyes with blanket. Like, the one for [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Imagination\|Imagination]] is the top one, and it is wide open.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: That does look like an evergreen thing.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Feel like they've been there for hours.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: They've been in there for ten minutes.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Yep. I wonder what's going on.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Yeah. By the way, I like the fact that Evergreen knows the princess's name, but, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Emery\|Emery]] doesn't. The princess told Evergreen her name.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Does it know? Well,
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Meanwhile, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Emery\|Emery]], a part of the Supreme Court, still doesn't know it. Like,
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Know [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Emery\|Emery]] knows [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Titania\|Titania]], but I don't think she knows [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Princess\|Rose]].
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Oh, no. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Emery\|Emery]] was they they were talking in the dinner that they had. Remember? They were friends.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Right. Oh, yeah. She may not yeah. She knows [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Titania\|Titania]].
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: No. The [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Princess\|princess]].
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Oh, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Princess\|Rose]]. Yeah. She probably knows [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Princess\|Rose]] now that I think about it.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Only a 3¢.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: No. Not Rose's true name. Only as [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Princess\|princess]]. Everybody knows her true name.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]] knows her true name.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: The heck did you manage that? She's a say.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I mean, she knows that that's true name too. So it's like a double edged sword.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Right. Mutual mutually assured destruction.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: And it was said that only a few people know the true name and and evergreenism.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Switching so much.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Breeze. You're okay.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I know.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Try to ground yourself.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Slightly worried we may have developed an alter of the most the biggest chaos junkie of all time.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: And it's a prop?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Speaking of chaos junkies, if [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|evergreen]] dies, do you know who [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Imagination\|Imagination]]'s going to their cheese o?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Seeing Chishol has a single brain cell, though.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: More than a single brain cell will be very interesting. Oh, yeah.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: The cheese is infinitely chaotic, and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Imagination\|Imagination]] is only less than chaotic than its host.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: So less than infinitely chaotic, it's still infinitely chaotic.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Oh, boy.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Oh, she has a similar shirt to to Marla. Hold on.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Because Marla has one of the I'm looking through your, your, descriptions. Marla has one of those, shirts that's just like a single piece of cloth.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: That, like, wraps around your neck and tucks into a belt.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: It's like a maroon color, like, maroon ish color for her.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: She's also, Silvis has also, like, major hearing loss in her left ear.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Instead of both sides, it's only one side for Silvis. Oh.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Gotta run to the bathroom. I can still hear you, so you can keep talking.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Nope. Not having fun. They haven't paid and probably have real.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Have fun. I'm gonna dissociate. I'm gonna dissociate for the next twenty minutes while we wait.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Oh my god. It's just it's literally just pickle. Oh my god.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Jarvis unshit my pants, please.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: How to spell? No. Please quote that. Please. Please. Please.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Sorry. I have no context for what you were laughing at. All I hear is it's literally just pickle. Jarvis, unchip my pants, please. Quote myself saying that?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: So quote me save that from what you heard.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: You go. Oh, I put it in the out of context.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Mean, it is that context.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I put in quotes too.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Oh, shit. My pants, please. Wait. This is in football. This is.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Never spelled the
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: No. It's literally just pickle.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: No. Uh-uh. Reverse card. The pie the pie the piecal. The piecal. It's like how you can spell thirst like this.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I hate this. I hate it. Why does it look so fleshy?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: What? What are you looking at?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Why does it look why does it look fleshy?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Sheldon, what are you doing in the toilet?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Sheldon, get out of there. Sheldon, get out of there.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: He just goes, I appear, but I've fallen in, as they might say.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Fucking tangent.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Elon mosquito.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Bone. The 206.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: That's one.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Oh. Oh, I get it. Oh, man. My head is way in the clouds right now.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: 1200 how would you pronounce that? 206.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: It'd be 1 and but 206.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Jen. I tear you to put statements backwards.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Hey, guys.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Jen, Jen, I dare you to say this backwards.
**DM**: Oh, hi, guys.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Deese nuts oh, no.
**DM**: Well played. Still boring. I have a default for it as well.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Can't believe ScribbleBot's recording all this.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: It's scribble bot. It's probably re recording when, when rainbow went off the rails laughing.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Which way did we go?
**DM**: As a as the three of you enter this room, you see in you went straightforward.
**DM**: Whatever orientation that is for you. I know you're trying to map out logically, which you will find out soon doesn't work because you're going to backtrack on yourself into a different room.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Oh, don't worry. I'll figure it out.
**DM**: Okay.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Oh, by the way, Court, would there be, like, a, like, shimmering, like, embers around her just, just like the residual, like, broken magic?
**DM**: It would be the complex circle on the floor which be, like, burned into the floor. Like, the scorch mark of it would still be there, but the actual circle is destroyed.
**DM**: And as the three of you enter, you see a really weird sight in front of you.
**DM**: Quite honestly, a very weird sight. You see a small well, looks like an amethyst dragon wyrmling who who has pounced on a person who who is, like, currently on top of a person who looks like that. They're maybe six foot tall in these long flowing purple robes. And this Wormling is, like, just giving [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] like, licking their face, like, hugging [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]. And you see Maria standing there.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: She she's not she's not she's not facing you guys, by the way.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I'm rolling history.
**DM**: Yeah. She's facing this, like, scorched circle on the floor. And as as you guys come into the room, the person who was tackled by the dragon, like, pats the dragon on the head. We have guests. Chet, can I get up? 
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:What does [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] know about dragons? 
**DM**:Anyone who wants to see how much they know about dragons, please give me a history, arcana, or nature check. All of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] are plus one. It doesn't matter because it's all intelligence. Yeah. The eighteen, seventeen.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: 17. No. 11. I can't fucking read.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I rolled Arcana.
**DM**: A lab. Okay. I think fifth would know it more from history. Yeah. They'll each give you slightly different things.
**DM**: M t t Oh, rainbow, you have advantage specifically because these are gemstone dragons. So, Maria, did you want me to
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Doesn't fucking matter. I got 11.
**DM**: Maria, did you wanna roll to see how much you actually knew about dragons?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: It was a 9.
**DM**: Okay. Yeah.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: When I when I get advantage, because I have the data dragon.
**DM**: No. Not not less is now.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Just because you adopted doesn't mean you're an expert.
**DM**: Yeah. The so who got, 15 plus?
**DM**: Yeah. So, you both know dragons, like, currently, dragons are not common in the world. You two you two none of you have ever seen a dragon of gemstones before.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Seen an amethyst one in Tallinn.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Kind of like [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/On the Epoch/Scribbles\|Scribbles]] in a way.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Well, like, the the shape.
**DM**: Oh, no. You have. You've seen you've seen the oh, you have. You actually you've seen an amethyst dragon before. Yep. So you this wyrmling looks very familiar to you, the little young one. But it looks like it looks in between [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/On the Epoch/Eden\|Eden]] and that dragon you met. It looks about about midway between. No bigger than [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/On the Epoch/Scribbles\|Scribbles]] still. Oh, I sure.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Duolingo has risen from the dead.
**DM**: Oh, For the vampire in you. It took me a second. But, yeah. So, you two would know that dragons are immensely powerful magical creatures. Like, even a small one like this, this could probably massacre a village if it was so inclined.
**DM**: And specifically [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]],
**DM**: That person is a dragon.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: 아
**DM**: But that person is that dragon is old enough to have learned how to shape shift. Shape shift is not fair. It's it's it is a true change in [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]selves, so true sight doesn't affect it. Right? Okay.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: How does [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/On the Epoch/Scribbles\|Scribbles]] react?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Hey, Court. Do you mind DMing me their name? That way I can put it in my sheet.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Maria has been making some pretty powerful allies.
**DM**: Yeah. Of course. I heard. Uh-huh.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: When I well, go ahead.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: How does [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/On the Epoch/Scribbles\|Scribbles]] react to it?
**DM**: Oh, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/On the Epoch/Scribbles\|Scribbles]] jumps jumps out, like, out from off from around your neck and immediately runs up to the smaller dragon and, like, head butts it and just goes, meh. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Neutral/Jethro\|Jethro]], in your mind, you see you see, like, pictures of this group, of things they've done, of how they've helped people, and just the care they have for people. And you also see a little bit about [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/On the Epoch/Scribbles\|Scribbles]]. They are a little dragon they're a dragon of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Owl of knowladge\|knowledge]] rather than a dragon of an element.
**DM**: And they want to know more about [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Neutral/Jethro\|Jethro]].
**DM**: And I will let those two be adorable together. It's like yeah.
**DM**: Yeah. The the like, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/On the Epoch/Scribbles\|Scribbles]] probably starts, like, lightly headbutting Geoffro and then sprints off around the room. But the woman turns and sort of laughs at this and
**DM**: Then looks at all of you. One more thing you would know, Jen, actually, is you gemstone dragons specifically are extremely magically powerful.
**DM**: They are they are psionic creatures, so they don't use the weave. They create magic of their own well. You would also know this dragon must at least be ancient for it to learn how to shapeshift. This dragon would barely fit into this room. This room is about 50 feet by 50 feet. This dragon would barely fit inside this room if it was in its true form.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Maria, who's your friend?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Myria would turn slowly to kind of face everyone else, and she just has this neutral look on her expression on her face. I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to say.
**DM**: You can all call me, if it helps.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: It's it's a pleasure to meet you, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Neutral/Em\|Em]].
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Evergreen's just watching it very closely, and I don't think she realizes she's doing that. Or if it's even is evergreen doing that.
**DM**: Oh, yeah. As as I know, the parts of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/The True End (The Grey)\|the gray]] know what this thing is. I know exactly how strong this thing is. 
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: And [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the White/Honor\|Honor]].
**DM**: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the White/Honor\|Honor]] does not. This is a gemstone dragon. This is something [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/The True End (The Grey)\|the gray]] made itself.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:Also, I do have a question. How much does [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Beth Baine\|Beth]] know about the jai live wars? 
**DM**:Not much. It's ancient history. Like, ancient ancient history.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Okay.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Sorry. It took a lot out of me breaking [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] out.
**DM**: And I am forever grateful for it. So you watch as, like, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/On the Epoch/Scribbles\|Scribbles]] and Jet start play fighting, like, nipping at each other, blow blowing little [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Spark\|Spark]]s of elemental breath at each other.
**DM**: Just Jenny being adorable.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I would take one of my potions of rest out of my bag and hand it to Maria.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Thank you. Anne was trapped here. Anne Maria would would look to the would kind of motion with her own, like, gaze, looking at the scorch marked, no more no longer existent magic circle that was on the ground.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Why would they
**DM**: Yeah. You can see some of the work on the floor then, and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] and Evergreen specifically.
**DM**: You two are the ones with the most understanding of magic here. This is powerful shit.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: What does the bee feel like in this room?
**DM**: It feels that we've this room particularly completely fine.
**DM**: Completely untouched.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Do you know who trapped you here?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: I have some information.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Sounds just like [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]].
**DM**: The magi trapped me here. I agreed I agreed to come visit their vault so they may learn of our kind, and they trapped me. Quite embarrassed, honestly.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: I have the information.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I just turned to Maria.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Guys hear evergreen mud or something in deep speech, by the way, towards the dragon?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Other than [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/No/The Wizard (Magnus the Mad)\|Magnus]]  being here.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: We have nine days.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Yes. But we didn't know if we had more or less days.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: At the minimum. That's for sure. At the minimum, nine days. So it's nine days to prevent him from
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Completing this body made purely from magic.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Magic born from nothing.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: K. Perfect vessel for him.
**DM**: The dog is just sitting there. Just like, set like feet up, probably next to Evergreen because Evergreen is giving the most scritches.
**DM**: After the first statement you make, everything else we are typing is in your hand.
**DM**: They are telepathic.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: A book reading is dissociating but speaking in full deep speech, not even, like, fully here. Mhmm. Okay. So she is still dissociating, but for other reasons.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Hawthorn\|Hawthorne]] just sort of goes, Looks like he's not as mad as we thought. He finally realized that taking the bodies of others was not ideal.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: In a sense, it it was in a sense, body snatching other people was an imperfect solution. But if we don't stop him, he will have his final solution.
**DM**: And I
**DM**: I can tell you the way, but I believe they actually look directly at Evergreen and at the, scroll the Wayfinder's map that's on Evergreen's hip. That will do as good a job as I. However,
**DM**: The guard of this place.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Know who you're talking about.
**DM**: He will be on.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Than that, and I have a I have a better idea.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: An older idea, actually.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I've literally been leading us there.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Yeah. I've been leading us there.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Do you know where we can find the control room? The one that the oh, okay. Never mind. The one that, like, controls the shifting of the rooms. Okay. Never mind. Okay. Just, like, void void what I just said.
**DM**: No. As as you say that, there's a quicker way to it.
**DM**: The map shows you the most direct known route.
**DM**: It will not show you the passages that aren't meant to be walked.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Alright.
**DM**: If you go if whatever member of this place is correct.
**DM**: If you go two rooms north, there will be a bookcase.
**DM**: It will take you down to the seventh level.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Not in the test tube room.
**DM**: That is all placed in the room. No. Two rooms.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: This is my brain.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Okay. Oh, no. We've been going that way. Okay.
**DM**: Two rooms north. So you you have not gone north yet. Yep. And then you've been going west. So two rooms north.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Okay. I'm just gonna go that way if this is north because they don't have and then there's a bookcase.
**DM**: Two rooms north, there is a bookcase.
**DM**: Will take you down to the seventh level immediately. And they look at they actually look at [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] for a moment.
**DM**: Interesting.
**DM**: Did not know Feyreault worships the divine. Or not anymore.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Is she, like, looking at the Yeah.
**DM**: They as well. They are very androgynous, this person.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Sorry. You've been referring to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] as she. 
**DM**:Yeah. Because they are more feminine, but they are
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Then would look over at AM and go, should you make it out of this vault, there is a location you'll be safe.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: You like me to give that you to that location?
**DM**: Thank you for the offer, but I believe I will be safe from most things in this world.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: I do indeed worship the divine, and I'm actually here looking for something for her.
**DM**: You're looking for her knife? 
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:Yes. 
**DM**:Yes.
**DM**: Four doors that way. Straight on. And they point, right from where you entered east.
**DM**: They point east $4. Now I have not spread my wings in a long time. Can one of you kindly tell me where the exit is?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Evergreen would just evergreen would say it out loud, but I don't think she still realized she's in that mindset.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: After a minute, she just blinked, shakes, and goes, yes. That might be difficult because stairs were all tiny wimey, fucky wonky.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: If you get to the forge, it is the, tin door.
**DM**: Carrie. Jefro. Kiddo.
**DM**: And Jefra probably, like, stops play fighting mid play fight and gets tackled by, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/On the Epoch/Scribbles\|Scribbles]].
**DM**: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/On the Epoch/Scribbles\|Scribbles]] is probably still about half the size of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Neutral/Jethro\|Jethro]]. Like, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Neutral/Jethro\|Jethro]] is a large creature. Like, small for a dragon but still pretty big. Whereas, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/On the Epoch/Scribbles\|Scribbles]] is still neck warmer sized.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Kinda wanna tell Am about [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/On the Epoch/Eden\|Eden]].
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Yes. So I'll I'll tell her that in, [[Reborn Again/Locations Gone to/Westvale/Depot 1\|Depot 1]], there is a tiny baby golden dragon who was my son.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Rescued him.
**DM**: Oh, that looks metallic. Adorable. I might give [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] a visit.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] that I'm Elliot and that I am okay.
**DM**: I will. Now, Lee.
**DM**: They reach into their mouth and their hand should not be able to fully fit in their mouth, but it does. They pull down and out of their mouth, they pull a amethyst tooth.
**DM**: But they keep pulling this and it is the size of a long sword.
**DM**: It is wide as well. It is wider than any long sword should be.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:Are they going to leave, like,
**DM**: just They probably would leave.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: No. Like, through the way that we go in. 
**DM**: Probably. That's their plan. That's what they've been saying. But, they pull this out, and they they look at all of you, and they hand it to Maria.
**DM**: And they go to Maria. If you ever truly need me, need help.
**DM**: Plant this in the ground.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Was I what was I handed?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Trying an ass tooth.
**DM**: A a gemstone tooth the size of a longsword.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Maria would Maria would kinda, like, strap it to her back basically along the blade length of her sword.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Careful. There are demons out there.
**DM**: Oh, what fun. If they attack me, I will get to emulate something for the first time in a long time.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Please do. He is quite annoying. He he's acting worse than an than a toxic ex boyfriend. Fucking dream invading piece of shit.
**DM**: Oh, you've been in your dreams. I'm actually steps towards you.
**DM**: And puts their hand on your head.
**DM**: And you get the distinct feeling of someone raking through your memories.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Evergreen lets it happen.
**DM**: Okay, I might wander unarmed for a few forests on my way back
**DM**: What mischief I can get up to.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: I was wondering if I might actually ask a favor.
**DM**: Yes.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: This bag holds seven bodies.
**DM**: Okay.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Would you be able to get [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] to, Councilwoman Highgrove? She's my mother.
**DM**: Where is this?
 **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:In the runners camp outside.
**DM**: What is a runners camp? Oh, well, I will learn. Anyway.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: The people that go into the vaults now, they go in here for fun.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I agree.
**DM**: Oh, why would anyone do this for fun? Anyway, not my problem. It has been a pleasure to meet all of you.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Sure I'll see you again.
**DM**: Simulacra.
**DM**: Don't share my secrets too much, will you?
**DM**: And in your mind, Jen, you get a distinct impression of what this thing is.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Oh, I love Jethero.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Just sort of, like, nod my head.
**DM**: I'm going to unselect by the holding just now.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Yeah.
**DM**: You did not ask to for the bag to be given back, did you?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Oh, no. Well, well, it doesn't fucking matter. I've got money.
**DM**: Yeah. Just buy one when we get out, if that's okay
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Yeah.
**DM**: Yeah, Jen. That that information is almost placed in your mind.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Urban also asked that not to hurt the farm. They're they're very nice and sweet.
**DM**: Oh, okay.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Just lonely.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Fuck, I can too!
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Doesn't even realize she's floating in the air.
**DM**: Okay. Evergreen, dragon.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Can you fly?
**DM**:  Not in here. Not in here. Way too small.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Okay. He does sort of nod and, like, as a show of respect, like, actually takes his bandana down and, like, puts it around his neck instead.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I mean, you might be able to fly in the farm room. It was quite big.
**DM**: How big how big is it? Do you remember being about a hundred feet tall and a couple thousand feet wide each time?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Really tall and really long.
**DM**: I'll see for myself.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: And she points she explains exactly how to get back to the farm.
**DM**: Okay, I will go. Now, she actually looks at the blank dog for a second and goes, Spot.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Gonna bring him to Tatania.
**DM**: Are you planning on leaving finally? Yep. Yep. I'm gonna follow these people. Would you like to come out just now and would you like to come out just now and wait for [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]?
**DM**: Yeah. Yep. Do, like, fall.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Yes.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Do spell slots count towards injuries? Oh.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I have not been injured.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I think I can get new spell slots back.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:Wish you luck on getting out
**DM**:Oh, I don't need luck.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: I know. But it's kind to extend the courtesy now.
**DM**: Do are any of you injured, by the way? Yes. Like please let me know if your total if your total injuries would add up to more than 200. No. No. No. Just health. Does. So anyone who is injured, I will actually click their finger, and you all feel a wave of energy pass over all of you as they cast power wood heal.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Does this remove my point in the process? 
**DM**: Yes. It does not give you spell slots back.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I asked if she had anything.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: 唱
**DM**: Not safely.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Have I ever been safe? There's a double meaning in that.
**DM**: She, like, she, like, puts her hand on your head. Can I get a constitution saving throw? You take you take two levels of exhaustion, but you gain all your spell slots back.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Oh, yeah.
**DM**: And you see, kind of, like, stagger a bit and go, I do not want finality showing up. I should not do that again.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I'm sorry? Oh, is that the angry one?
**DM**: No. Don't worry about it. If if a woman with, like, a clock tower as a hat shows up, tell her I was never here, please.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Tell her with that. How can one work?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: So that's not the one with the two swords.
**DM**: No. Anyway, it was lovely to meet you all, but I would really like to see the sun. Wouldn't you, Jaffro?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Evergreen offers a hug.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: For both reasons.
**DM**: Takes a hug. And I'm a
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: And Evergreen will let [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/The True End (The Grey)\|the gray]] energy, like, flow off of her very strongly in the moment.
**DM**: Yeah. Yeah. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Neutral/Jethro\|Jethro]], this small halfling feels very, very safe.
**DM**: Just instinctually. This halfling feels amazingly safe.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: If you make it to Talon, there might be people there that might like to see you.
**DM**: I will go. I do not know what Talon is or where it is located, but I will find out. And I see no water.
**DM**: Assume it left to change.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Doesn't Apple take good? The world's not what it looks like. Yeah.
**DM**: But I will enjoy exploring and learning once again.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Do not go off of do not go down.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Are all floating in the sky.
**DM**: Jet, no going down when we get outside.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: You could die.
**DM**: I mean it. I don't want you to die. I want you to go big and strong like me. Yeah?
**DM**: You're amazing, kiddo. Come along. And does she take me off on her before she leaves, actually? She does. But that's not her biggest priority in this room. Just and does Jet does Jet do anything before they all leave?
**DM**: Does does the do they also pounce on, Maria for freeing their mother?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I looked at through.
**DM**: The little worbling. Like, you mentioned you had a little golden hatchling, didn't you?
**DM**: Jen, you mentioned you had your little hatchling. Your hatchling. Your,
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Yes. I mentioned [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/On the Epoch/Eden\|Eden]], but [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/On the Epoch/Eden\|Eden]] is back on, in Deepa 1.
**DM**: Yeah. They will kick you and go. Is there anything you would like you would like me to take back to your little hatchling?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I have any magic items?
**DM**: You did pick up a very strong one.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Yeah. I'm I'm gonna see if if which one is better. The the
**DM**: Honestly, I prefer the staff in general.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I already had a Staff of Thunder and Lightning, didn't I?
**DM**: Well, that's what I mean. Like, but out of your weapons you have, that one is the better one.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Yeah. I'll I will hand the, the dragon, the hammer of thunderbolts.
**DM**: Yeah. They take it and go, you'll enjoy this.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I appreciate this.
**DM**: You're a good time. Here. I have no use for this, and he hands over the Trident. Yeah. And I will eat in this grill for it.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Don't be alarmed at the mimic horde.
**DM**: Oh, I won't. So and they actually they stop in this room for a second, and this room's pretty barren. But they, like, reach under their wrist, and from nowhere, they pull out a book, and they hand it to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]].
**DM**: And in the front of on the front of it, you cannot re read voice speech, can you?
**DM**: There is an incomprehensible language, but I will go. This is my work that I have done during my time here.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: You want, I can help translate it.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Appreciate it. I will. He hands the book to Evergreen.
**DM**: Evergreen. This is, on the front is the is basically a engineering guide for proto mage AI technology.
**DM**: And it's got a lot of personal notes from this dragon and it's got a lot of designs from this dragon that you have seen in this vault already. Like, a lot of the golems in here that you faced, they designed and they just they just hand it to you and go, Enjoy.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Translate it when we get back for you. Be safe.
**DM**: Will see you all later. And Myria Vamova.
**DM**: Thank you and good luck to all of you. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] actually burns. Yes they they they kind of nod at you and go you didn't recognize the word Feyrot what do you call [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] now? You're kind?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:Shifters. 
**DM**: I like that better.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Yeah. Careful of the elder brain. He's very nice.
**DM**: I know of mind. Do not worry.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: He's very nice, and I like him.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: He's free. He's free and safe and healed. Took a lot out of me.
**DM**: I got an acid bath. Nice. He's free. I'm glad. Yeah. They, like, crack their neck, and they walk out as well. Please hold out for you for a minute while I do this.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I gotta go piss as well.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Gonna be taking a dissociation break.
**DM**: Maybe a five minute piss break. Don't fall in the high school court. Uh-huh. I love Jeffress so much. Yeah. You're getting [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] in your head.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Therapist hasn't texted me. My therapist usually texts me to confirm the session for
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Therapist hasn't texted me for tomorrow.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I don't think I have my therapy tomorrow. Okay?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Oh, not good.
asher: The fact that I also have therapy tomorrow, kinda base.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I'm being forced to talk about my mental health issues.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: And the fact that my dad's birthday is this year.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Oh, good lord. There's going to be conflict in [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]'s brain.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Is going to ask if it's okay to give the book to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/On the Epoch/Scribbles\|Scribbles]] and then translate it.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Just so Swan [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/On the Epoch/Scribbles\|Scribbles]] grows into that knowledge won't be lost.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:: Know, you don't have to get
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: And would ask if it's okay.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I would say it'd be okay.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Fifth speaks voice speech.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: So does Evergreen.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Thought you were deep speech.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I know deep speech and void speech.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Oh, right. The the the the thing that that that I'm great at words today.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Owl of knowladge\|Knowledge]] and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Imagination\|Imagination]] [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Imagination\|Imagination]] gave me deep speech. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Owl of knowladge\|Knowledge]] gave me void speech.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Okay. That's my fault. I didn't know that. I'm sorry.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Yeah. I I speak both.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Deep space is just what she leans towards because she is maxed out with [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Imagination\|Imagination]].
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Also, Evergreen would take out, like, the bag of seeds she got from the pharmacist. I got seeds from the farm, guys.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Were really nice.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Potatoes needed a little bit of a scolding.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: You see the pumpkin?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Potatoes and pumpkins needed a little bit of a scolding for hurting me, but besides that, they were really nice. Or they tried to.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Well, this is going to be an odd piece of paperwork to send to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Glint\|Glint]]. I don't know how I react to this. I've heard you say a stranger's name.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I've also got grape I've got grape seeds as I've got the grapes as well. They were very lonely.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: The wheat was very nice too. They were just protective.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Need to apologize next time we see [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]], [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]].
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Am not apologizing to a plant that can't understand me.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Evergreen glares and says apologize to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]].
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: She is not folding on this. I could talk to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]], but they need they are sentient. You need to apologize.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: How would you feel if someone came into your home and started killing your family in front of you?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Oh, that was a low blow. Like, I'm seeing this out correctly.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: That's what it evergreen I don't think evergreen would realize it's a low blow, though.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Don't think Evergreen knows.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Because out of character, they fucking did.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Yeah. No. Yeah. Evergreen doesn't know this. I don't think.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: That blares, like, very harshly.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Did I say something wrong?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: People got fathers?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Not anymore. He died in a fire.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Oh, that's why you're afraid of fire.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Just thought it was Holt because of the cat thing.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/DEAD/Allendro Dar'Marvo\|Allendro]] and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Demons/CULTS/The White Spears\|the White Spears]] quite literally set my house on fire, killing my father.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Speaking of I don't know where my dad is.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Don't know who my dad is.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Samt.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: The control room. The path that m laid out for us.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: How we proceed?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: We might actually have to wait for court.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Gotta wait for court before we can. We're just doing role play.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Oh, also, Jenny, the the rest potion, what does that do?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: It's basically like a short rest.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Look up potion of rest.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Mean, technically, we could take a short rest here if we need it.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Possibly. We'll have to ask her if that's a good idea.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I mean, we're it's only, like, in campaign. It's only, like, 09:00 ish.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: So it's not been long. We've only been here for three hours. Taking an hour to rest wouldn't be a bad idea.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Because we don't know what we're gonna find in the core or in the vault for [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Luna\|Luna]].
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Oh, no. Short risk is not sleep.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Not want to sleep because that is
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Short rest is just, like, taking a minute to just take a break.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Technically, physically can't if he wants to keep the, bonus thing that he got from Laura where he gets, advantage on all saving throws.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: That's before it stops at a short rest.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Yes. Specifically, yes.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Should we go to the thing? This is out of character. Should we go to the [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Luna\|Luna]] thing first before we go down to the horror?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Because we're on the same floor for the [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Luna\|Luna]] thing.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: The core is closer. Oh, okay.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Is the same floor.
**DM**: I mean, I would personally say nothing first because we'd like we have, like, days. You and you have spent about I will say you've now spent about three and a half hours in this vault. Maybe you close it to four. I'll say about four, actually.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I feel like we should do the [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Luna\|Luna]] thing first, and then if we can do the core.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Because
**DM**: Yeah. Because you I I will say something that you all know. You will know when this resets. You will no longer know where either of these, like, shot like, the shortcut to the car, or at least to the floor the car is on, and the you will not know where it or the [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Luna\|Luna]] Vault is.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: There's no guarantee we could get back to this point if we don't do both right now.
**DM**: Yes. And even if you get back to this room, there's no guarantee that either of those places will be the same again. Fuck my phone. 
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: It's the bathroom with you.
**DM**: Uh-huh. 
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Oh, baby.
**DM**: I think so.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: I think you did too.
**DM**: You're checking the whole company.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Yeah.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: So we're real good doing the [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Luna\|Luna]] thing first and then going to the core.
**DM**: Okay.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Because that is, out of all of the quests we have, we have the temporal clock to fix, save Kehlani, kill [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/No/The Wizard (Magnus the Mad)\|Magnus]] , shut the core off, and save the [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Luna\|Luna]]sword.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Mhmm. I feel like balloon and sword might be the best idea.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Luna\|Luna]]sort is on this floor on Secure Vault 7.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Next one we can do after that is shut the core off.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: The rest of those can wait for the next time we enter.
**DM**: Oh, looking up parts of my eyes.
**DM**: Mhmm.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: If you said you were looking for
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: A Philly cheese steak sounds like the bomb right now.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Fair. And you said you're looking for the [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Luna\|Luna]] thing. Do we wanna go there?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:One second till I can look at Court's screen again.
**DM**: You don't need to look at the screen to tell [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Calculations\|Hawk]].
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Yes. I would.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Emily said that way, she points and says, are y'all ready to try and go?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: As I'll ever be. So you are going
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: To the [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Luna\|Luna]] sword.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:: So to the right, I believe.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Was to the right four rooms.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: One second.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Oh. Oh, okay.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Oh, no. Wait. What's the farm, the room with seven things in it or no?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Oh, no.
**DM**: No. That was one thing. The tag that I got for the farm, it was a farm, and it was mildly alive.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I can't believe I scolded the potatoes.
**DM**: Was the tag. What's going on? One of the research labs is one with many things in it. So you reach it. You you go through this dog. Who is going first? I kept the dog.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Do that, Mary. I could take a leave.
**DM**: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] and Maria. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] and Maria because you both said it at the same time. Yes.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Well, I guess we're, like usual, taking the lead.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Her brain's in the middle. She's too fucking squishy for the shit.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Oh, shit.
**DM**: As you step through this door, you see from a door opposite you. Oh no. A figure. Oh no. You step through it. Tall, made of living metal. Similar to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]].
**DM**: But while [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] is [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] is tall, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] is how tall are you again then?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Hold on. I don't I don't have it written down.
**DM**: You're like you're like six five or something. You're tall.
**DM**: This figure made of liquid metal is easily nine foot tall.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Maria Maria would finally don her helmet again, and just say to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], brace yourself.
**DM**: And they are they are this tall. They are built massively. They are almost body proportions. Their arms almost reach the floor. They carry no weapons. But you see their knuckles are pointed, like sharp points out of their knuckles.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Smash.
**DM**: They are glowing where you see [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] glow glow with this red energy, this one glows with a deep blue.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Do I know what the blue is?
**DM**: Not really. K. And just [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], you see a faintest hint of a [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/The True End (The Grey)\|gray]] mist out of one eye.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Great.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Six.
**DM**: Evergreen would see it too, and they get a note. There they would. But can I get everyone to roll me initiative? As as you all step in, as the two others step in right behind you, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]] cocks its head.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: I did worse. Fuck. Okay. No. I got six.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Jenny. Do you wanna do best two of three just to see who goes first?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: 24 
**DM**: okay. Give me a moment. I need to do your initiatives. What are your deck scores? Are they both plus one?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: No. The new 2024 rules. I thought we were going by those.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Plus five. Oh, wait. Hold on. Dex is plus one. Yeah.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: We're both plus one. So I just rolled for to see, like, rolled for best two out of three, and I rolled the 19.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Guys can just decide who goes.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Hey, Jenny. Role initiative again.
**DM**: No. Just to break the tie. No. Just to get [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] to break the tie. Then you can do it.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: 13.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Okay. I'll go before you.
**DM**: Yeah. Now, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], would you like to enact your sneaky bastard ship?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: What do you mean?
**DM**: You can swap initiatives with anyone you want.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Typed the initiatives for you.
**DM**: That is the current initiatives you can see. I will roll. So I will I will describe this room while [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] is thinking. I've got [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]. The room is about 40 feet by 40 feet.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Ok.
**DM**: It is not a large room. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]]
**DM**: Is at the far end.
**DM**: And no, it's a bit bigger than 40 feet by 40 feet. Sorry. It's
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: 400 feet.
**DM**: No. It's it's 80 feet by 80 feet. Sorry.
**DM**: It's a bit it's bigger than I remembered. It seems to be some sort of
**DM**: Like, it seems to be like a meeting room almost. There were tables scattered around. There were notes, places, and
**DM**: There is a door at the far end where [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]] came in, and there is a door to the right.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Gotta go to the right. This is out of character. This would be known because that's the way that the dragon's ending.
**DM**: No. It would be straightforward now.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Straightforward? Okay.
**DM**: Because they said out that door four wait four times, so it'd be straightforward now. You need to go Pecalani.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Yeah. She's clearly go through her.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Said it was like a meeting room? Okay. Give me a minute.
**DM**: Yeah. It's a meeting room. And as just before combat starts, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]] cocks its head at you specifically then and goes, I'm sorry, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Ava\|Ava]].
**DM**: Did not want to have to do this.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Not yourself. I understand.
**DM**: I am doing what I was made for. Protecting my fault.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]. Don't listen to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]. We're gonna have to weaken [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] if we have any chance of getting through.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Don't know if that's possible.
**DM**: And the Evergreen.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Does it feel like [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the White/Vengence\|vengeance]] did?
**DM**: There is a wisp of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/The True End (The Grey)\|gray]] smoke coming out of one of its eyes. And just for a moment, just for you, you swear you see a spectral [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/The True End (The Grey)\|gray]] [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Calculations\|hawk]].
**DM**: Settingon kalanı hiç oldu.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: This is gonna take long time. Right? Hey, guys.
**DM**: So I hate to tell you, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], you aren't actually going first because
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: What? Excuse me?
**DM**: The, one of the effects of calculation. They may choose where they go in initiative. I think they decide to go before the rogue. So you are positioned the four of you are quite close together. You're basically in a line.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Oh
**DM**:, like, two behind. No. It'd actually be [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] and Evergreen behind, and then Maria and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] in front.
**DM**: And [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]]'s chest opens. Fuck. And you guys have seen this before. You've seen this when [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] does a similar thing.
**DM**: And as [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]]'s action, they are going to use their call to cause a cone of cold.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I don't have enough to do counterspell it, guys.
**DM**: Yeah. Does that
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Did I get a soul from the sent Sentinel?
**DM**: Oh, you technically would have.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I counterspell that motherfucker.
**DM**: Yeah. What level?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: It's the [[[[Imagination\|[[Imagination]]]] one.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Would be six level.
**DM**: Yeah. So that is next level. Can you please roll for me?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: What is the role?
**DM**: Because this is higher than sixth level.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Желтый
**DM**: It is e d 20 plus your charisma.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Plus my Christmas. So I can just do a cruise spiral.
**DM**: Yeah. I need a lot of d eights if this fails.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Evergreen is still in the foxhorn because it hasn't worn off yet.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Just. So how do is this fuck. One second.
**DM**: Can you please reroll that for me? Oh, no. As that [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/The True End (The Grey)\|gray]] mist in their eye, that entire eye and everyone sees it, that eye flashes [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/The True End (The Grey)\|gray]] for a second.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Evergreen reaches out to curiosity to all of the shards she has and says, please help me roll this good.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: 17.
**DM**: Good luck. 
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: How does [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the White/Honor\|Honor]] react to that?
**DM**: No.
**DM**: No. Right. Can I get a constitution saving throw from all of you? I need to find all my d eights.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Okay. Okay. Thank God. 25.
**DM**: 20 5 20 2. 2 passes. 18.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: The way, I just threw this quickly. There's no tables or anything in this room, but this is an 80 by 80 square for you guys.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: So that'd be 40 by 40?
**DM**: Thank you very much. Eighteen's a mess, isn't it? That's completely fine. I don't I don't it's 80 foot by 80 foot, not 80 squares by 80 squares. Nope. Divided by five. 20 by 20. Thank you very much. Because
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Want me to put, like, a table or two in there?
**DM**: Yeah. Just a couple. Like, tables and chairs. Just doesn't have to be great. It'll probably take me a while. Kaye, what's your constitution saving throw?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Constitution saving throw. Oh, God. Hold on.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Oh, that would be
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: 26.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: So I got a 21.
**DM**: Remember, all of you get a cross fall. Oh, two then. Yes. I should know not to throw a saving throws at you guys anymore. Only person that gets saving throws from now on is [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] because it's more likely that they fail a save than I get from. Also, I need to roll this call. 21. You all pass because, of course, you all do. Am I out of d eight? No. There's one there. Cool. So that is how many d eights is this thing? Eight d eight at base level. My god. Do we not have one more?
**DM**: Nope. That's fine. That's not some good that's some bad rolls. That does that though.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Do I wish I had my boots a cold right now?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Is it possible to reason with [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]] at this point?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: 30 if you passed.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Okay. How much? Like, 30.
**DM**: You are unsure. So that is 60 cold damage, half to anyone who succeeded, and then half again for [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] because [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] has resistance to cold. Can select you some kind of dodge for this. Why? Because I'm 30.
**DM**: This is a big ass spell right off the bat. He is not underestimating you guys.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: My lucky mix that greater.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: I'm glad my hit points were maxed out.
**DM**: Yeah. I'm not demonstrating. You take photo.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Can't I uncanny dodge this? 
**DM**: Because uncanny dodge is only an attack. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Ava\|Ava]]sion.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Wait. I'm behind [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]. I'm technically in half cover.
**DM**: Yeah. You get you get an additional plus two to the save.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I've already passed this.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Can I pass it three times over?
**DM**: Yeah. They got some text. No. Is that the thing done? Perfect.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Yeah. Yeah. That quick throw of you, I don't really care of what it fucking looks like.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Let me ask if you needed any potential ones.
**DM**: Yeah. Completely fine. I am just gonna steal it immediately and use it because it is better than anything I didn't I had because I didn't have anything. Yeah. No. But I I have 40 rooms here.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Wait a minute.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Fair. You didn't know that we would fuck with [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]] right now.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: DM, you said that the dragon lady would or dragon person would buy us time with [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]].
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Oh.
**DM**: Yeah. But they didn't they didn't know which way [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]] was coming from. They they aren't they're good. They're not that good.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Oh, man.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: They're not they're not psychic. They're telepathic.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: They are psycho.
**DM**: Yeah. There's a there's a difference. They're telepathic. Mild difference. Apply to background.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: The core is what is what's controlling [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]]. Right? Or is that just the rooms?
**DM**: That's like, it is the same thing.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Okay, so if they shut down the core then [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]] will stop.
**DM**: I know your idea. Sorry. I am making us a map, so it's easy. You can hear that too. Yeah. You're not hallucinating. Hey. And then I will add [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]].
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Like, what was the save for the cold?
**DM**: It was a constitution. I am not telling you the DC yet.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: No. Because of my two levels of exhaustion, I need to minus four. So it would be 22.
**DM**: What would your total be? You're fine. Yeah. We've also got 22. Two levels of exhaustion, but full spell slots.
**DM**: Think that's kind of worth it. Resize, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]. Oh, because I'm small. Oh, no. Because this map's slightly smaller than the last one. Oh, okay. Like the square sizes. Okay. And then Maria. Maria. Sorry.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Looks like my time with headphones that are cooperating is up.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I have five goals. That's good.
**DM**: No. Do you want me to put the dry stuff in the back? No. I'm gonna need a few of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]].
**DM**: It just saving for us to get an advantage on? Was it on that cross? It's just saving for us. Okay. Right. I now have map.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: So if that is firing Pilani's eyes, that means
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I am not too good against Columbia.
**DM**: Maybe. So that was Calani's that was Calani's action. As a bonus action, they are going to press their hand to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]selves and cast a spell.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Don't have countless brokers.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: I don't think I have the range to hit [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] with anti magic test.
**DM**: Yeah. Not so. But [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] counter spells [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]]'s haste, and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]] only had one use of that.
**DM**: Damn it.
**DM**: Okay that is [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]]'s turn it does its eyes lock to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] at that though but it's not going to move it's going to stay over that next up is [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]].
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: How far away is it?
**DM**: Five ten fifteen twenty twenty five thirty five forty forty five fifty, 50 five, 60, 60 five, 70, 70 feet.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Am I shooting at disadvantage would be?
**DM**: You would be. You're 40 minimum, so you need to get closer.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Okay. I'd get closer, but only to be in the range of 40 feet.
**DM**: Give you five, ten, 15, 20, 20 five, 30, 30, five, 40.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Bang. Okay. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
 Say it louder and in character.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Hey, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]]. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
**DM**: So I lock into that gun as you fire.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Oh, fuck.
**DM**: So that's just a d eight. Yeah? Just a d eight. What one are you using? That's a six. That is a good one. Is it is it is it is it is it 12345? Petroglyph. So what is my saving for? Dex. Ah, yes. The mountain of muscle. How's a zero? Lucy? Yay.
**DM**: No. Sorry. How's the fall? What do you think?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Okay. That's less funny.
**DM**: Yeah. No. Sorry. I forgot. He he does have an aura. He has the paladin effect sort of thing that gives him a bonus.
**DM**: That's it it was a zero before I remembered that existed.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: That's hilarious.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Kinda pathetic if you did.
**DM**: So he is going to use his only legendary resistance on that to pass the save because he sees the beam. He knows what it does. He is not being turned to stone like that. Yeah. Honestly, kind of pathetic if you just get turned to stone for an entire combat. And, I chuck corner. I get advantage, don't I? Because I hit with Yes.
**DM**: I just 20 9. That's, I'm grabbing b eight plus nine.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: And what's your DC again? Or your AC?
**DM**: Sertin.
**DM**: Is this bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: I don't remember slashing.
**DM**: Okay.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:
**DM**: Wait. No. Would it not be piercing because I'm chucking him. Nope. Still slashing.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:
**DM**: Okay. But you're, like, arc it. Right. So how much?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: 13, I believe. 
**DM**: Sure. Would you like to interdict him?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:  Yes.
**DM**: Okay. He is interdicted. Okay. That is [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] Go. Next up is Evergreen.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Okay. Do I know what that chart of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/The True End (The Grey)\|the gray]] is on?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I'm gonna need to really lean into [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the White/Honor\|Honor]] for this one.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Not [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the White/Honor\|Honor]]. What the fuck's the [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Owl of knowladge\|knowledge]]. Sorry. My brain. The [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/The True End (The Grey)\|the gray]] stuff isn't going to work very well.
**DM**: Probably not. Would you like to move from behind the wall that is Maria?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I need to actually, no. It's within a 20 feet. No. I do not.

While you have this [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Owl of knowladge\|knowledge]], the target cannot become hidden from you. And if it has the invisible condition, it gains no benefits of the condition against you.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: And 25 damage.

**DM**: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], can you make me a wisdom saving throw, please? You do, however, have a plus four because Maria's close enough to you.
**DM**: Oh yeah we're still yeah you still have it. I still have advantage. Because you've not short rested. I was 25. You feel ice begin to fall on you trying to freeze you in place but you flex and it just breaks off and it just cocks its head at you.
**DM**: It grinds. It grinds back. A macabre mockery. Lovely.
**DM**: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]], you're up. Oh, you didn't tell me [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the White/Honor\|Honor]]s.

**DM**: You probably need to be at least five foot closer.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Alright. I'm gonna move five foot closer and cast hold person.

**DM**: And Cox, and it says, why are you fighting me?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: I will say, Councilman [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/No/The Wizard (Magnus the Mad)\|Magnus]]  has been sentenced to death for making a deal with the Abolithic.
**DM**: State your evidence.
**DM**: Is about when you get out in your turn.

**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Pretty much.
**DM**: Five, ten, 15, 20, 20 five. So its first punch is going to go directly into one of these goals. It's what they're there for. It is going to reckless attack.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: What the fuck does that mean?
**DM**: All all its melee attacks now have advantage. All melee attacks against it also have advantage. Okay. The start of his next turn.
**DM**: How's a 20 two?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I'm con so the goals AC is equal to my proficiency bonus. Right?

**DM**: Yeah. So your DC is 23.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: How the fuck do I roll this? Where the fuck is it?
**DM**: It's a conceive on it.

**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: What is it? Like, 16?

**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: You're the one who made the rule.
**DM**: Oh, is it? Can you can you read me this effect?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Let me get back on to it because it keeps resetting the app.

**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Wait. Couldn't I technically put that new armor on the ghoul?
**DM**: You could. Oh yeah. No. As a note, your ghouls do have free attunement slots each.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Oh, now that's something.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Would I have known this?
**DM**: It takes an hour to
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: You have a fucking army.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Okay. So it wouldn't have but the ambulance of health, I could have given to one.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: As court looks up the AMULA to health.
**DM**: It wouldn't have had time to attune, but it would work.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: No. I got it. I I've had that, before we enter the vault.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Yes. Thank you. Oh my god.

**DM**: Means what is it your is it the ability of the blade, or is it your reaction? But it's one of your react.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: No. It's not the blade. Let me go to features and traits real quick.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: No. It wouldn't be in there, would it?
**DM**: It would be a feat, which features and traits.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: No. Yeah. Nature's wrath. As a magic action, you can expend one use of channel divinity to conjure spectral vines around each creature of your choice that you wait a minute. No. That's not the one.

**DM**: Protection is what you're looking for. Right? A creature within five feet of you. Very popular creatures in small.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Okay. So yeah. So okay. So I guess just forget all the times that I did, 15 feet because I was probably inaccurate.
**DM**: Yeah. Yeah. That's that's my mistake up until this point. Your blade
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Shit. Because I I I thought I remembered you enhanced it to 15 feet. Never [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Mind\|mind]].
**DM**: No. There there are that that could definitely be something that goes on your blade when you awaken it, which is very close to happening, quite honestly.
**DM**: Yeah.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Well, I mean, I just got up to 15 on my reputation, but the thing is, it won't take effect until I sleep.
**DM**: Yeah. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], I'm very sorry.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Hey, Danny.

**DM**: Oh, Jen's not there right now. Give Jen a second.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: While you're giving Jen a second, I need to keep your help doing the math here.

**DM**: Increases its health by 15.

**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: It says that it does.
**DM**: Yeah. But you are much higher level. For each dice it has in its health, and ghouls don't have dice, but we're hand waving that for a sec. I'm going to say 15. How many?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Two d four plus two.
**DM**: Yeah. But then it gets oh, then it would only it would only actually increase it by six.

**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: That's a 14.
**DM**: Ping. Okay. It is going to use its reaction when you miss it with an attack, and it is going to fire its second fist at you. Double that one. Double that one. It is impossible to hit itself or it would.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Wait, is is it shooting with a weapon? Would that make it explode?
**DM**: Oh, no. It's, literally firing its fists. At people.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Of my goals has 41 health now.
**DM**: For no apparent reason.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: It has an amulet on it.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Okay. I've wrapped my toe. Oh, that was bad.
**DM**: Mhmm.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Yeet.
**DM**: You do not get advantage because you did not hit with your foot. Nope.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Fuck.
**DM**: Actually, as one of the fist is retracting, it just flicks the chain up, and it just hits the on or out of the way, and it reforms in your hand. You have a bonus action.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: I do.
**DM**: No. That's a funny one to try. I'm gonna have to roll really low for it to succeed, but I did just roll double that once. I don't I don't know. Oh, you can summon [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the White/Honor\|Honor]]. Yeah. I can't do that. Remembering class features. These two days are being replaced. Yeah.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: I summon [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the White/Honor\|Honor]].
**DM**: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the White/Honor\|Honor]].
**DM**: Right next to him?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Yes.
**DM**: Pesky.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: For a very specific reason.
**DM**: Pesky little fly.
**DM**: End of your turn. No. We can't. Can't. Yeah. Yeah. Evergreen.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I'm gonna move up. So wait. Can I get move up so Maria and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] are within 10 feet of me?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I I don't think I could do that with [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] as well, could I?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Cool. S
**DM**: 51015202530. Yes. You can. You end up here directly in the nexus of everyone. Exactly. Oh god. That is such a good code of code.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: As my action, I'm tossing down one of my tossable kernels.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Each creature within 10 feet of meat gains two d four plus two temporary HP.
**DM**: Okay. You roll once, and it affects everyone.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Everyone gets nine temporary HP.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Yay. Thank you.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: 9 10. Should I just nine or do I put it in 10? Nine 10.
**DM**: Tempe different. Because you can just yield under your temp. So you can if you go up to 97 for whatever reason, you still have your temp.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: So and then as my action no. That was my action. Was it?
**DM**: Think it's your action. What does it say?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: It just says I can toss it down. It doesn't say
**DM**: As a action, a bonus action?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Gonna send a screenshot because it doesn't say.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: It just says I could toss it down.
**DM**: It doesn't say, I'm gonna say that's a bonus action. No, that's an object interaction. That is quite literally an object interaction.
**DM**: No, you can use an action to throw the kernel up to 20 feet.
**DM**: Yeah. But you get the benefit now as well.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I didn't have to move that. I could have planted it there or tossed it. Yeah. So that was my action because that was object interaction.
**DM**: That was your action. Yeah.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: So bonus action.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Who's look I was rev looking.
**DM**: Yeah. Chug. Chug. Chug. Wait. I've got on the plus eight. No. You're not close enough to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]. How is [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] looking?
**DM**: Actual health of third, though.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Okay. So I am still the lowest. I am going to cast
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Healing word.
**DM**: 5, 10, 15, 20, 20 5, 30. Can you make me a wisdom check before you heal?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Okay. So don't spend the spell slot yet.
**DM**: No. Spend the spell slot, but please make me a wisdom check a wisdom saving throw. You get a plus eight because you're close enough to both.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Plus a 18.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: So I get
**DM**: You are fine. You cold coming off. As you try to cast the spell, your fingers go almost numb, so you struggle to actually shape the magic.
**DM**: But then again, from behind you, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]'s heat. The heat that naturally comes off [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] just brings you that warmth.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Mhmm. And I am having the ghoul move to the opposite corner.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Or in so, like, it cannot get, like, line of sight of me. Oh, it.
**DM**: It can get to here is the best it can do with 60.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: That's a lie, my friend.
**DM**: Hiding there is probably its best bet.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Yeah. It's trying to stay out of line of sight as much as possible.
**DM**: It's gonna run that way.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Think that's all I can do. I am at full HP now.
**DM**: Okay. Maria.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: They 30 feet from me?
**DM**: Are less than 30 feet from you. They are 15 feet from you.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: E u.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: I faced frontline disposable warforged tougher than you.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: And I would cast compelled dual. Wisdom saving wisdom save, 16.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Rest in peace, Maria.
**DM**: 15. Oh. I fail.
**DM**: I've used my legendary resistance already. So, yeah, compelled your works.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Maria would just dart over to the, Felice? Felani.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Alyce's from Game of Thrones, my friend.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Understand any of these references.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Goddamn it. Oh, well, I think I got
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Kaleesi is the mother of dragons.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: I forgot. Okay.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Anyway, I got a anyway, I got does a 20 hit?
**DM**: 20 does hit [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]]. I've already used my reaction. I cannot cast shield.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Okay. First up, 15 plus a one d four. That's, 17 in total there.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: I already dashed way like, I already cast haste, like, way earlier.
**DM**: You? Yeah. You, which would have run out by now because it's a minute. So but you do have the you have a time to speak.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: I know. I know. So that just means that I'm I only have half my, charges left.
**DM**: Yeah, you do have a divine smite though.
**DM**: That you can that you roll now, I think. I would like to burn my seal.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: I'm pretty sure they're resistant to fire damage.
**DM**: Well, then it actually
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Well, we can find out.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Although they are giving off the call giving off cold, so how about I combat that? I'm gonna roll two d eight for the fire damage.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: 11.
**DM**: Yep. Does not seem to resist it.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: And for the divine smite,
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: At second level
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Which I'll put on the cast list. That's three d eight for another 16 damage.
**DM**: It does not seem to resist that either.
**DM**: So I can't tell you exactly because I've I cleared my, pad I'm writing it on, but the last the fire and the radian was 27 total.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: 20 7 17.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: 2915.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: No, you're forgetting about the one d four that I roll.
**DM**: No. That is that is including the default because they said '29 instead of 20 7.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: 29 plus 15. So that would be I don't fuck about this.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: And that's just my first attack.
**DM**: Yes.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: And that would be like, Maria is like dragging the sword along the ground type kind of upper cut where it just, just.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Just breaks chunks out of the ground as she swings up at Kehlani.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: With that first attack.
**DM**: Yep. You have a second attack.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: This one's just gonna be like she's gonna try and well,
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Attempt to hit her.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: Yeah. 17 doesn't hit. I'm pretty sure.
**DM**: Nope. Nope. A c is 20.

**DM**: Yep. Is that your turn?

**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Okay. Do I get a post four?
**DM**: Maria, you no longer get any bonuses. You do not get any no. You get a plus follow. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] does not get any bonuses. Right. Because Maria moved away from you. You get your own benefit. That's it. Nothing else.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Got 10.

**DM**: So you are you are all you're all good. You are all under the effects of the slow spell. Everyone's a I will remind you of this. Everyone's AC is reduced by two. Everyone's movement is halved. You may take an action or a bonus action, but not both. You may not take reactions.
**DM**: You get a save at the end of your turn but it is a minute otherwise.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I'm glad I did the health thing beforehand, guys.
**DM**: But, yeah, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]], you are up. You're moving me on.

**DM**: Can I get a persuasion check?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: I use a reaction to cast guidance?
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Lovely. Okay. This is probably not gonna work very well. No. Ten. It was almost a d twenty.

**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]**: Do you think was the one who was ordered to kill him?
**DM**: You might not, but I do. Interesting. Answer.

**DM**: Remember, you can take an action or a bonus action, not both.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: This is special, does that?
**DM**: What does that do? You can still use it.
**DM**: You do need to hit with [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the White/Honor\|Honor]] first.
**DM**: You get to add a default to that How many from Blair. No. Default, not four.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Evergreen as an item.
**DM**: So a default
**DM**: One, which makes it empty.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Technically, she said I could do that.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Makes it an 18.

**DM**: Yeah. 2109 because you're correct. 
**DM**:Yeah. Lovely. 20.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Is it normal sneak attack? It is normal sneak attack but doubled, so we're all 66.
**DM**: Yeah. Credit 66.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Lobs, shit. Sixteen, sixteen.
**DM**: Would you like to spend any charges or because the any damage charges you spend would be doubled.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**:One. 
**DM**:Okay. You you're only allowed to spend one. So
**DM**: Leaving yourself one counter spell.

**DM**: Precisely. So it's Two d eight. So double to four d eight. And Oh. This is a nonresistant damage type as well.

 Nope. No plus. 
**DM**:Just straight run 48. It's a bonus of 48.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: Oh.
**DM**:Your plus nine is the damage on the weapon.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]**: Is Kehlani looking?
**DM**: 20 two, and he takes full damage from that. Okay. Above half health.
**[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria v'mova]]**: You can try. You can fucking try.
