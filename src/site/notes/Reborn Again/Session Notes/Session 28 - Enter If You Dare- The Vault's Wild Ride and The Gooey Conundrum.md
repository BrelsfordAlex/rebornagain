# Funny Moments
---
Here are some funny moments from the transcript:

1. **The Dice Troll:**
    
    - THEM: "Actually trolled one d four instead of rolling one d four."
    - _Turn2Frog_: "Troll one d four. You're a pointy bitch."  
        The confusion between "roll" and "troll" led to some hilarious miscommunication.
2. **The Goblin Guard with an Eye Patch:**
    
    - Viv: "Buddy, might help if you took the cap off your scope."
    - Goblin Guard: "Oh. That might be why everything's dark. It's not nighttime?"  
        The goblin guard was trying to watch the wall with the scope's cap still on. He then switches his eye patch to the good eye but still can't see because there's no eye under the patch.
3. **The Ever Growing Bookworm (Scribbles):**
    
    - _Turn2Frog_: "Scribbles has been getting steadily bigger."
    - Myria Evergreen: "Scribbles, you have to make sure you can still fit out the door, buddy."  
        Scribbles, the weird, growing, book-eating creature, casually gets bigger as he devours more books.
4. **The Unfortunate Coffee Sip:**
    
    - Myria Evergreen tries a sip of some suspicious coffee:
        - _Turn2Frog_: "Until your next short rest, you have advantage on dexterity checks, attacks, and saving throws."
        - Myria Evergreen: "Guys, I'm gonna fucking crash."  
            She realizes the caffeine high gave her super focus... until the inevitable crash.
5. **The Vault Library Trap:**
    
    - Viv picks up a book titled _"50 Ways to Successfully Disguise a Trap"_ — and it's a trap.
    - THEM: "You just opened a book that was called 'Disguising Traps'."
    - Myria Evergreen: "Yeah, they're fucking traps!"  
        Fif gets hit with 40 points of poison damage after opening the most obviously suspicious book.
6. **The Tentacle Trouble:**
    
    - Viv keeps getting grabbed by tentacles.
    - THEM: "Can someone please play the Pornhub intro?"  
        As Viv gets dunked into acid by tentacles again, the group leans into the ridiculousness of the situation.
7. **Evergreen's Six-Foot Glow-Up:**
    
    - Evergreen drinks a potion and temporarily grows to six feet tall.
    - THEM: "Wow. Never thought I'd know what the underside of your face looks like."
    - DM: "You are under the effects of the Enlarge spell."  
        Her brief giant halfling moment becomes peak comedy.
8. **The Robe of Infinite Uselessness:**
    
    - Evergreen pulls items from the "Robe of Useful Items" — among them, a 20-foot ladder, a rowboat, and four Mastiffs.
    - Myria Evergreen: "Guys, I have an open pit that is a 10-foot cube."
    - THEM: "I just imagine dropping one of those golems down into the pit."  
        The group ponders turning the Vault into a dog park or setting up traps using the most random assortment of tools.
9. **The Mind Flayer Confusion:**
    
    - When facing a corrupted Elder Brain, Evergreen tries using the "Whistle of Freedom" to cleanse it.
    - _Turn2Frog_: "This is something much more powerful than dominate person."
    - Evergreen: "I can't fix him?"  
        The group debates whether they're here to fight or adopt the corrupted brain.
10. **The Tentacle Obsession Continues:**
    
	- Viv gets tentacle-grabbed again.
	- THEM: "We need a soundboard. This is getting out of hand."  
	    The entire party realizes Viv’s fate is to eternally be the tentacle magnet.
11.  After Maria V'mova fired her shotgun at Evergreen to counter the magical compulsion, the group joked around, "I’m just imagining I’m just imagining like the Super Mario go back to small form sound where it goes do do do do do."
12. -Maria V'mova expertly quipped about Viv's characteristic "sticky fingers" after she took a hefty load of valuable metals, saying, "Says the three people who loot way more than I ever fucking do in this damn campaign."

## Day Morning of the 31st of Springdawn Year: 2451 PS

---

### **1. Preparing to Enter the Vault**

- The party gathers at camp to finalize their strategy before entering the ancient vault. **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] Baine**, **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]]**, **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]] V'mova**, and **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]]** discuss possible dangers, the vault’s known shifting structure, and how to utilize the compass for navigation.
- The compass, which can be tapped on doorways up to **five times a day** to reveal the layout of the next room, becomes a central part of their navigation plan.
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria Evergreen]]** offers to map the vault by hand to reduce reliance on the compass, knowing its uses are limited. Her meticulous nature makes her the ideal candidate for this task.
- The group also discusses the known dangers within the vault: shifting rooms, possible constructs, traps, and a potential **Elder Brain** rumored to inhabit the depths.

---

### **2. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv Baine]]’s Goblin Encounter**

- Before entering the vault, **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv Baine]]** takes a walk to clear his mind and encounters a **goblin guard** stationed at the camp’s wall.
- The goblin, hilariously inept, peers through a scoped rifle but can’t see anything—only for [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] to realize he’s left the **lens cap on**.
- After helping the goblin fix the issue, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] notices the goblin wears an **eyepatch**—which turns out to be purely decorative, not functional. The goblin insists he just likes the aesthetic.
- Despite his amusement, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] leaves the goblin better prepared and heads back to camp, reflecting on the bizarre characters they often meet.

---

### **3. Consulting [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Owl of knowladge\|Knowledge]]: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]’s Insight**

- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria Evergreen]]** retreats to a quiet corner of camp and summons her magical owl **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Owl of knowladge\|Knowledge]]** to gain further insight into the vault.
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Owl of knowladge\|Knowledge]] explains the vault’s origins, revealing it was created by the **Protomagai**—an ancient civilization of mages obsessed with [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Owl of knowladge\|knowledge]] and immortality.
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] learns that the vault follows a complex shifting cycle, realigning its rooms every **200 years**, making navigation nearly impossible for most.
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Owl of knowladge\|Knowledge]] warns of the presence of an **Elder Brain**, a massive, psionic entity, and hints that the vault may have layers of defenses—both magical and mundane.
- When asked about the possibility of **Revivify** working in the vault, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Owl of knowladge\|Knowledge]] gives an uncertain answer, adding to the party's growing unease.

---

### **4. Choosing the West Door**

- The party regroups and debates which of the four vault doors (North, South, East, West) to enter.
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]]** suggests the **West Door**, citing symbolic reasons tied to their past experiences in **[[Reborn Again/Locations Gone to/Westvale/Westvale\|Westvale]]**.
- After a brief back-and-forth, **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] Baine** and **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]] V'mova** agree, and the party steps through the **West Door** into the unknown.

---

### **5. The Library of Traps**

- They find themselves in a vast **library-like room** filled with ancient tomes, dusty shelves, and strange magical auras.
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]]** quickly notices books that seem "off," while **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] Baine** explores on his own, his curiosity getting the better of him.
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] picks up a book titled _"50 Ways to Disguise a Trap"_—triggering a **poison gas trap**. He inhales the gas, taking **40 points of poison damage**, leaving him coughing and furious.
- The group rallies to solve the puzzle, realizing that the "fake" books hide clues to the exit.
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/On the Epoch/Scribbles\|Scribbles]]**, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]’s magical fox-like companion, grows larger as it devours books, its wings sprouting and shimmering with magical energy.

---

### **6. The Painting Hallway: Eight Schools of Magic**

- Beyond the library, the party enters a grand hallway lined with **eight magical paintings**, each representing one of the eight schools of magic:
    - **Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Transmutation, Necromancy, Illusion, and Evocation.**
- Certain paintings have **Sylvan inscriptions**, which **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]] V'mova** deciphers using her experience with the Fae:
    - **Divination** reads _Observation_.
    - **Transmutation** reads _Forge_.
    - **Evocation** reads _Defenses_.
    - **Necromancy** reads _Below_.
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]]** deduces that the inscriptions act as clues to the vault's layout and potential paths forward.
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]]** uses the compass to determine that the **Forge** is the most promising path, leading to a potential workshop or armory.

---

### **7. The Superheated Forge Room**

- The party steps into the **Forge Room**, a vast chamber filled with molten magma, anvils, and ingots of valuable metals—most notably **adamantine** and **mithril**.
- The oppressive heat forces the party to make **Constitution saves**—several members gain exhaustion, while **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]]** cleverly uses her ghouls to navigate the more dangerous areas.
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]] V'mova** methodically gathers several ingots, later storing [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|them]] in a **Bag of Holding**, while **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] Baine** remains wary of potential traps.
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]]’s summoned **hellhound, Sable**, scouts the magma pools, confirming there are no hidden dangers beneath.

---

### **8. Tactical Planning and Trap Disarmament**

- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria Evergreen]]** uses her **ghouls** as disposable trap disarmers, sending [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|them]] ahead into rooms to trigger potential dangers safely.
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]]** and **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]] V'mova** debate the ethics of using the ghouls as "meat shields," but [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]] reminds [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|them]] that the ghouls are magical constructs, not sentient beings.
- The party focuses on preserving resources, only using the compass sparingly while continuing to map the vault by hand.

---

### **9. Combat: Silver Golem Ambush**

- In a narrow chamber, the party is ambushed by **four silver golems**—powerful constructs guarding the vault’s deeper levels.
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv Baine]]** uses his enchanted firearm, **Beauty**, which fires unpredictable magical bullets. One shot slows a golem, limiting its attacks.
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]]** activates _Sunbeam_, blasting radiant energy through two golems and blinding [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|them]].
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria V'mova]]** uses raw strength and her enchanted blade to physically tear apart another golem, ripping its torso in half.
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria Evergreen]]** commands her ghouls to swarm the final golem, overwhelming it and breaking its core.

---

### **10. The Organic Chamber: The Elder Brain**

- The party enters a massive **organic chamber**, the walls pulsating with a fleshy texture and pools of acidic liquid scattered throughout.
- In the center floats the enormous **Elder Brain**, its massive tendrils writhing, black ichor dripping from several of them.
- The Elder Brain speaks telepathically: _“He hungers. I must feed.”_
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]]** realizes the brain is partially sentient but corrupted by the ichorous infection.

---

### **11. Dilemma: To Save or Destroy the Elder Brain?**

- The party debates what to do. **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]]** briefly considers feeding it the **bag of heads** she carries but hesitates.
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] Baine** dives into the acidic pool to get a closer look, only to be grabbed by a corrupted tendril and submerged in acid, forcing him to fight while drowning.
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]]** attempts to calm the Elder Brain through psionics, learning that its hunger is artificial, caused by the corruption.
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]] V'mova** hears the Elder Brain telepathically beg, _“End this… or save me.”_

---

### **12. The [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Mind\|Mind]] Flayer Emerges**

- As they deliberate, a **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Mind\|Mind]] Flayer** steps out from the organic walls, revealing itself as the source of the infection.
- Combat ensues:
    - **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]]** summons more ghouls and uses _Lesser Restoration_ to begin cleansing the corruption.
    - **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]]** uses their **Hourglass** to summon **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Marcus Menneth\|Marcus]]**, a celestial ally who aids in the fight.
    - **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] Baine**, embracing his **lunar transformation**, battles the [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Mind\|Mind]] Flayer while still submerged in acid.
    - **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]] V'mova** focuses on severing the corrupted tendrils, using her divine powers to burn away the infection.

---

### **13. Cleansing the Elder Brain**

- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]]** uses a **fourth-level Lesser Restoration** to cleanse the majority of the infection from the Elder Brain’s surface.
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Marcus Menneth\|Marcus]]** delivers two radiant strikes directly into the infection, burning it away.
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] Baine**, with the final push, uses his **enchanted pistol** to destroy the last corrupted tendril.
- The Elder Brain lets out a psychic shockwave, forcing the [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Mind\|Mind]] Flayer to **plane shift** and escape.
- As the ichor evaporates, the Elder Brain speaks clearly: _“Thank you… I am free.”_

---

### **14. Aftermath: Time, Shifting Rooms, and Future Dangers**

- With the Elder Brain restored, the party learns that **temporal anomalies** in the vault have caused certain rooms to shift out of sync, leading to the vault’s unstable layout.
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]]** theorizes that the **Forge Room’s time dilation** is accelerating the vault’s cycle, causing rooms to move earlier than expected.
- The Elder Brain offers guidance deeper into the vault but warns of lingering threats—there are still sealed chambers hiding secrets and dangers.
- Before leaving, **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]]** checks the compass: 8am, meaning they’ve been in the vault for nearly 2 hours—but the shifting time flows leave [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|them]] uncertain of how much real-world time has passed.
