### [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria Evergreen]]'s Dream Encounter

- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]’s dream:** She experiences a vivid and sinister dream involving a throne of skulls, drenched in a surreal atmosphere of blood and despair. The dream starts as she approaches the figure sitting atop the throne.
- **Wisdom save:** [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] rolls a 17, managing to hold her composure despite the horrifying imagery and the oppressive aura of the dream.
- **Entity:** A towering 15-foot figure looms over her. It mocks her, calling her "little mortal" in a tone that exudes superiority and menace. (was the [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Demons/Skulltaker\|Skulltaker]])
- **Attack and Loss:** The entity wields an axe and attacks her, severing her right arm in the dream. As [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] touches her weapon, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the White/Vengence\|Vengeance]], her arm reappears as a misty, ethereal limb, but it feels unfamiliar.
- **Dialogue and Threats:** The entity claims to have burned down her village, describing scenes of ashes, cinders, and demonic rampage. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]], filled with fury, threatens the entity with unwavering determination, declaring she will end it if its claims are true.
- **Partial Dream Control:** With a successful Charisma check, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] alters the dreamscape. The blood-soaked battlefield morphs into a tranquil forest clearing, and she takes on her true kitsune form, complete with tails and ears. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Imagination\|Imagination]] and Knowledge, two guiding aspects of her psyche, appear to support her.
- **Battle and Retaliation:** The entity attempts to assert dominance, stepping off its throne and attempting another attack. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]], now more in control, uses [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the White/Vengence\|Vengeance]] to strike back, slashing at the back of the entity’s knees. She reduces its maximum hit points by 40 in reality.
- **Aftermath:** [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] wakes up in her bed, deeply shaken. She processes the encounter, grappling with a sense of foreboding and the feeling that her actions in the dream may have unintended consequences.
