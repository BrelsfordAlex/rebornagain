- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]] dryly suggests that if looters got to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|them]] first, it wouldn’t be their fault.
- The conversation shifts to their next steps as the party prepares to move.

#### **Exploring the Vault - The Acid Room & Fleshy Walls**

- The group proceeds through the vault, with [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] visibly uncomfortable about their surroundings.
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] teases [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]], referencing a past encounter in a similarly unsettling environment.
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]] groans and covers their face, trying to ignore [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]’s relentless taunting.
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] touches the walls, discovering their unsettling, fleshy texture, much to her amusement and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]]’s horror.
- The party consults their map, confirming that their path leads downward.
- A brief debate occurs on which route to take, but ultimately, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]], despite their reluctance, volunteers to lead.

#### **The Underground Farm Encounter**

- The group descends into an enormous underground chamber that mimics an outdoor field.
- Artificial sunlight streams from the ceiling, illuminating a vast array of crops.
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]’s natural druidic instincts kick in, and she attempts to communicate with the plants, but they remain eerily silent.
- The crops sway and shift slightly, their movements unnatural and unsettling.
- Scanning the area, the party spots key landmarks: a bronze star at the far end, a silver door to the left, and a gold door to the right.
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]], intrigued, loudly greets the plants. The response is immediate: wheat stalks whip out, attempting to ensnare her.
- Initiative is rolled as the party prepares for battle.

#### **Battle in the Underground Farm**

- The wheat lashes out at the group, attempting to pull [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|them]] into the field.
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] nimbly dodges, slashing through stalks with precision.
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]] summons their steed, carefully navigating the battlefield to avoid trampling the crops.
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] channels her magic into a soothing breeze, using Druidcraft to communicate with the plants.
- The wheat hesitates, slowly bending to allow the party passage.
- Despite this, the party is forced to traverse other sections of the field: the root vegetables and grapevines still pose unknown threats.
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] shifts into a feline form, using their increased speed to sprint toward the door.
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]], enhancing herself with Haste, blurs past [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] in a flash of metal.
- The plants, still defensive, attempt to ensnare [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|them]], forcing the party to remain cautious.
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] takes the opportunity to gather seeds from the awakened crops, intending to study [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|them]] later.

#### **Arrival at the Storage Room**

- The party emerges into a storage chamber filled with large steel chests, each securely locked.
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], wasting no time, picks the locks, uncovering valuable items: red gemstones, serpent venom, and an intricately crafted scimitar.
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]], opting for brute force, smashes open a chest, revealing a hoard of gold and a legendary Hammer of Thunderbolts.
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]], arriving later than the others, misses out on some loot but finds awakened seeds and vine cuttings, treasures of a different kind.
- A discussion ensues about whether they should take a brief rest before continuing forward, but time is pressing.

#### **Encountering [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]] - The Vault Guardian**

- The next chamber they enter is a meeting hall, where they come face to face with [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]], the vault’s massive liquid-metal guardian.
- Standing nine feet tall, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]]’s glowing blue energy is an imposing sight.
- Recognizing [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]], [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]] offers a brief, chilling apology: "I am doing what I was made for."
- Without hesitation, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]] attacks, unleashing a powerful Cone of Cold.

- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] attempts to petrify [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]] with a well-placed shot, but [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]]’s resistance negates the effect.
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]] appeals to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]]’s logic, citing their orders from [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Arbitration\|Arbitration]] and the Architect.
- A subtle flicker in [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]]’s system suggests a moment of hesitation—a glitch.
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]] charges in, engaging [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]] in melee, inflicting radiant and fire damage.
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]] retaliates by seizing [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]] and hurling her at [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], causing both to crash into the ground.

#### **Disabling [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]] & The [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Calculations\|Hawk]]’s Revelation**

- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]] and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] escalate the glitch effect within [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]].
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]] forces [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]] to confront the multitude of souls within [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|them]], causing [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]]’s systems to shut down.
- With [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]] temporarily inactive, the party debates their next move.
- A spectral [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/The True End (The Grey)\|gray]] [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Calculations\|hawk]] materializes on [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]]’s shoulder, addressing [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]] directly.
- The [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Calculations\|hawk]] cryptically states, "He is trying to fight it."
- Recognizing that [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]]’s corruption is tied to an external force, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] attempts Lesser Restoration, but the effect is negligible.
- The [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Calculations\|hawk]] informs [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|them]] that [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]] cannot be truly freed until a specific individual is eliminated.
- Rather than risk further conflict, the party chooses to leave [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]] in stasis and move toward their next objective.
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] elects to split off from the group to retrieve [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Luna\|Luna]]’s sword from a separate vault.
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] instructs one of her protective ghouls to follow [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], ensuring their safety.

#### **Session Ends - A Race Against Time**

- As the session concludes, the party splits up:
    - [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]], [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]], and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] head toward the Core, determined to shut it down before [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]] reactivates.
    - [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], accompanied by the ghoul, embarks on a dangerous solo mission to retrieve [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Luna\|Luna]]’s sword.
