- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]] is confused**, and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]] clarifies:

### **The [[Reborn Again/Locations Gone to/Westvale/Necropolis\|Necropolis]] Vault & Vaults in General**

- **The Vault Core exists in every major vault**—it controls its stability.
- **Vaults were originally designed for research, containment, and experimentation.**
- **[[Reborn Again/Locations Gone to/Westvale/Necropolis\|Necropolis]] has at least 10 levels** ([[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Neutral/Bigrove\|Bigrove]] reached Level 10).
- **The Core Room is located on Level 7**, and controlling it could stabilize the vault.
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]] is one of the original guardians of the vault, meant to eliminate intruders.**

### **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/No/The Wizard (Magnus the Mad)\|Magnus]] & The Long-Term Threat**

- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/No/The Wizard (Magnus the Mad)\|Magnus]] is inside the vault and has been modifying it to his advantage.**
- **He does not use Weave magic**, making him immune to the vault’s magical instability.
- **He previously experimented on [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]], creating the magic runes [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]] now uses.**
- **His corruption spreads across the land**, though [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]] was able to **halt its advance**.
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/No/The Wizard (Magnus the Mad)\|Magnus]]' ultimate goal remains unknown, but time is running out (9 days remain).**

### **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]]’s Hometown & Mysterious Destruction**

- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]]’s hometown was erased from existence**, leaving behind only a cursed church.
- **The Shade Rifts that destroyed [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]]’s home originated from this church.**
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Baba Yalaina\|Baba Yalania]] helped [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]] destroy the church**, suggesting it was a **source of dark power.**
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]]’s mother and stepfather were likely involved in something sinister.**
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]] and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]] lived in the same town, but centuries apart.**
- **Time manipulation or a long-term plot may be at play.**

### **The Settlement & Its Political Structure**

- **Vault runners are a nomadic, highly organized group** that rely on vault expeditions for survival.
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Neutral/Bigrove\|Bigrove]] is a key leader** but does not follow any religion, unlike most settlers.
- **The town has a history of selling magical items**, sometimes to dangerous individuals like [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/No/The Wizard (Magnus the Mad)\|Magnus]].
- **The town has fey skulls impaled on spikes**, suggesting past conflicts with the fey.

### **Religious & Mythological Aspects**

- **The gods exist but are rarely directly involved.**
- **The moon briefly flashed white**, which may indicate divine interference.
- **Fey influence is still strong in certain areas**, as seen with [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Baba Yalaina\|Baba Yalania]] and the destruction of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]]’s town.

# Things of Importance

---
### **Vault Expedition & Immediate Dangers**

- **The [[Reborn Again/Locations Gone to/Westvale/Necropolis\|Necropolis]] Vault is shifting mid-expedition**, which is highly abnormal.
- **The Vault Core is on Level 7** and stabilizing it would stop the vault from shifting.
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]], also known as "The Reaper"**, patrols the vault and **attacks intruders on sight**.
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/No/The Wizard (Magnus the Mad)\|Magnus]] is inside the vault and is altering reality.**
- **Vault expeditions are high-risk**—some groups have not returned.
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Neutral/Gavin\|Gavin]]’s team lost a member but resurrected him**—others were injured.
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Neutral/Bigrove\|Bigrove]] is stopping all other expeditions** until the party attempts to stabilize the vault.

### **Magic Instability & [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/No/The Wizard (Magnus the Mad)\|Magnus]]' Influence**

- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/No/The Wizard (Magnus the Mad)\|Magnus]] is burning away magic**, causing Weave-based spells to fluctuate.
- **Magic still functions normally up to Level 4** (according to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Neutral/Gavin\|Gavin]]’s report).
- **Divine/Natural magic (shard-based) is less affected than Arcane magic**.
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]]’s ghouls can phase through walls**, making [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|them]] useful for scouting ahead.
- **Teleportation magic is unreliable in the vault**.

### **Time Constraints & The Party's Plan**

- **The party has 9 days before [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/No/The Wizard (Magnus the Mad)\|Magnus]] enacts his plan**.
- **The goal is to reach Level 7** to disable the Vault Core.
- **They are using a teleportation compass to prevent getting lost.**
- **If they encounter [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Unknown/Kalani\|Kalani]], [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]] will attempt communication first.**
- **If they disable the Core, the vault will stop shifting, making further exploration safer.**
- **Loot rooms contain valuable resources that may aid the mission.**

### **The Settlement & Its Culture**

- **Councilwoman [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Neutral/Bigrove\|Bigrove]] is [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Vivienne]]’s mother** and a powerful figure in the settlement.
- **Death in the settlement is treated casually**—the first death can be undone, but the second is permanent.
- **Resurrection magic exists but is rare**—each person can only be revived once.
- **The settlement sells magic and relics to survive**, sometimes to dangerous individuals like [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/No/The Wizard (Magnus the Mad)\|Magnus]].
- **The town has a heavy vault-runner presence**, with many groups depending on vault loot to sustain themselves.
