A fifth entity exists but doesn't control the body.
    - He recounts the tragic origin of his current state: his father, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/No/The Wizard (Magnus the Mad)\|Magnus]], transferred his soul into a robot body.
    - He struggles with being perceived as a "monster" due to his imposing 6-foot frame, contrasting with his original 4'1" height.

  - [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] discusses the Cult of Last Days and its connections to her past, including her abusive stepfather, who led one of its sects in [[Reborn Again/Locations Gone to/Westvale/Westvale\|Westvale]].

        - She encourages him to continue building tools like grav bombs, as they could be crucial in the coming battles.

    - **GM**: "She strikes, strikes, strikes, moving, moving bats. Like, she is a blur as she moves. And then she goes, yep. Assistance might be appreciated here. Mortals and Divines tend to have better luck working together on these things."

    - **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]**: "You become closer to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Luna\|Luna]]. Your body grows, your claws extend in moonlight, and you get these constellation marks up your fur."
    - **GM**: "[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the White/Honor\|Honor]] appears in plate mail armor with a scythe.

    - **GM**: "[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the White/Honor\|Honor]] takes a fucking beating, but just keeps going, shifting a large tower shield in one arm, scythe out, slashing from behind the shield."
    - **GM**: "[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], you're fighting up close with your claws, and you're shifting between realities—an infinite number of Vivs fighting with you."
- The entity seems to be impervious to damage, but the group pushes it back with relentless teamwork. At the climax of the fight, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Luna\|Luna]] kicks the entity out of a mirrored space, sealing it shut.
    - **GM**: "The three of you push it back, and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Luna\|Luna]] waves her hand. A crack appears in the wall, showing flashes of other battles between gods."

    - **GM**: "As you take hits, you don’t feel [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]], but you see [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] appear on [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Luna\|Luna]], and she heals [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] quickly."

    - **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]  [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]]**: "[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/On the Epoch/Scribbles\|Scribbles]], have you been behaving?"
    - **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Foxie\|Foxy]]**: "Oh, I learned that very quickly. It’s fine. You only got the full word before I stopped him."

### **5. The Book for [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Foxie\|Foxy]]**

- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]] gives [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Foxie\|Foxy]] a signed book she bought for her, and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Foxie\|Foxy]] blushes slightly, appreciating the gesture.
    - **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]  [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]]**: "I had the woman sign it: 'To [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Foxie\|Foxy]] from [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]].'

- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Neutral/Maeve\|Maeve]]suggests using biomancy to create plants that grow food quickly. The GM confirms that it’s theoretically possible, but it won’t be a fast process.
    - [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Neutral/Maeve\|Maeve]]: "Is it possible to create plants that either grow more food or grow very, very fast?"
    - **GM**: "Theoretically, yes. It should not be that difficult."
