### Day 19th of Springdawn Year: 10044

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **1. Arrival in the City**

- The party ([[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]], [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]], and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]]) arrives in the city, immediately noticing its strange, unnatural harmony:
    - **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]]** identifies the city layout as a spell, with roads and intersections forming magical patterns.
    - **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]** observes that the roads’ enchantments are more vibrant than typical infrastructure magic, signaling something unnatural about the city’s design.
    - **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]] and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]]** notice that eyes follow [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|them]] wherever they go, switching between individuals in the streets.
    - The **surveillance** is unnerving:
        - The eyes constantly change watchers when someone is directly observed.
        - Individuals act as though pre-programmed, stepping aside without thought and catching objects without noticing [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|them]].

---

#### **2. Initial Investigations**

- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]] and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]** discuss the implications of the surveillance:
    
    - [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]] notes that the soldiers in the military camp are unaffected, while the city’s civilians behave like drones.
    - [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] hypothesizes that the spell’s focus might be in the city’s core and that strong-willed individuals could resist the enchantment.
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]]** attempts to connect to the city’s [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Neutral/Tau-Weave\|weave]]:
    
    - Using personal magic, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]] senses that the city operates as a layered suggestion spell.
    - [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Owl of knowladge\|Knowledge]] confirms that the spell is decades old, requires a focus, and is layered over time to alter consciousness.
    - [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]] deduces that breaking the focus would disrupt the entire spell but worries about potential chaos in the city.
- **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]] trains under [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Borranth\|Baranth]] (the mimic disguised as a goblin):**
    
    - [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Borranth\|Baranth]] teaches [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]] how to mimic the mindless drone behavior of the city’s populace.
    - [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]] develops a convincing backstory as an assistant to the expedition, learning to move and act as if under the spell.

---

#### **3. Split Activities**

##### **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]] Performs at the Bar (Red District):**

- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]] enters a tavern to gather information, playing music as a performer to blend in:
    - Plays for over two hours, captivating the crowd and earning admiration.
    - Two aristocratic mages watch her closely, clearly testing her loyalty and observing whether she is under the spell.
    - [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]] sends her telepathic rat [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/On the Epoch/Cranium Rat\|Cranium Rat]] to eavesdrop on the mages, who discuss:
        - Meeting with their “associates.”
        - Plans to "change" before attending the meeting.
    - The performance draws significant attention, but [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]] avoids suspicion by presenting herself as a local performer.
    - Exhausted after her performance, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]] notes the mages leaving the tavern around 11 PM.

    - Experiences the city’s suggestion spell:
        - Briefly believes she has lived in the city her entire life and is its captain of the guard.
        - Shakes off the effect but retains the memory of the illusion, realizing the spell is exceptionally strong.
    - Drinks with the [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Neutral/Maledos\|Maledos]] for over an hour, subtly probing his behavior while maintaining a polite facade.

##### **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] Tracks the [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Neutral/Maledos\|Maledos]]:**

- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] observes the [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Neutral/Maledos\|Maledos]] leaving the tavern and follows him at a distance:

- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]] attempts to connect to the natural energy of the city, sitting under a large oak tree in the camp:
    - Discovers that the city’s nature is lifeless, its magic drained by the enchantments in the roads.
    - Feels the vibrancy of nature being absorbed, leaving the environment barren and unnatural.
    - This realization deeply affects [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Maria v'mova\|Maria]], and she sheds a tear while reflecting on the state of the city.

    - Amber warns [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] about acting rashly, noting that the group will need concrete evidence to accuse the [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Neutral/Maledos\|Maledos]] or confront him.

##### **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Evergreen]] Creates a Safehouse:**
