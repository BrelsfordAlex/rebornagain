- Initial Interaction Between [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]]:  
      
    

- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], still adjusting to the situation, greets [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|THEM]] ([[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]]). There's some confusion as to who [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] is speaking to, which leads to a conversation where [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] expresses his unease about the war and the safety of his clan.
    
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]] acknowledges the worry, relating to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]'s feelings by mentioning their own family and the concern for [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|them]]. This leads to a moment of trust, where [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] offers to meet [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]]'s family if possible.

- ## [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]] Reveals Family:  
      
    

- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]] explains that their sister, Amelie, is still alive and living in the family home. Despite the passage of time (70 years since [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]]’s last time in this body), their family remains a part of their life. They also mention that they are surprised their family is still around.
    
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], still unsure of how to interact with [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]]’s family, expresses a desire to meet [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]] but also shows hesitation, fearing the reaction to his appearance and complex nature.
    
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]] reassures [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], explaining that their family is understanding, even though there’s still a deep sense of apprehension from [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]].
    

- ## Introduction to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]]'s Family:  
      
    

- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]] and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] arrive at Amelie’s home, which is described as a quaint, old house with a thatched roof. Upon entering, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] immediately shows respect by removing her shoes.
    
- Amelie, though an older woman, greets [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]] with a warm hug, showing affection despite her age. She introduces herself as the head of the household, mentioning that her family has had interrogators before, and expresses openness to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]].
    
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], cautious due to his past experiences, is initially unsure of how to engage but is quickly soothed by Amelie’s tenderness and understanding nature.
    
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], after some interaction, feels comfortable enough to remove his interrogator’s equipment and almost collapses in a mix of emotional exhaustion and physical weariness.
    

- ## Family Connections and Shared Moments:  
      
    

-  Amelie, a perceptive woman, notices [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]’s state of mind and gently pats [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]’s head while giving advice about the mismatched internal and external selves. This gesture brings comfort to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], though it is emotionally charged.
    
- A younger woman, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Ella Halcot\|Ella]], enters with a baby boy, who immediately reaches out to grab [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]’s tail, drawing a light-hearted response from the family. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], shifting into his leopard form, humorously interacts with the baby, letting the child play with her fur.
    
- The scene continues with a lighthearted and endearing moment where [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], still in leopard form, tries to keep the baby entertained, while [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Ella Halcot\|Ella]] and Amelie find the interaction amusing.
    

- ## Meal and Personal Connections:  
      
    

- A hearty meal is served, with Amelie preparing a thick, savory soup. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]], enjoying the nostalgic moment, expresses how much they’ve missed this kind of food, revealing a sense of deep attachment to their roots in Tallinn.
    
- In a playful exchange, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] teases [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]] about their apparent distaste for soup, joking about the inferiority of their mother's cooking.
    
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]] laughs but insists that [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]’s mother’s soup is lovely, further displaying the familial bond shared in their conversation.
    
- The meal brings out more personal revelations, including [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]]’s awkward but endearing confession of a past relationship with someone named [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Marcus Menneth\|Marcus]]. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]] blushes as they reveal the person’s identity, and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], noticing their discomfort, responds with supportive comments about their relationship.
    

- ## The Upcoming Battle and Bonding Ritual:  
      
    

- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]], as they prepare for the upcoming war, discusses old traditions with [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]. One such tradition includes braiding each other’s hair to signify camaraderie before a battle. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]] presents [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] with a bead they found and fashioned into a token, sharing that it was a meaningful gesture among their friends before combat.
    
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]] braids a strand of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]’s hair, creating a symbolic connection between [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]]. This act of solidarity reinforces their bond and the sense of mutual support. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]] emphasizes that they would stand by [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]’s side in the coming battle, reinforcing their commitment to one another.
    

- ## [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]’s Vulnerability and Support from [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]]:  
      
    

- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] experiences a moment of vulnerability, crying and expressing gratitude toward [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]] for respecting their gender identity. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]], with unwavering support, reassures [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], saying they would never disrespect [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]] and would stand up for [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|them]] if others did.
    
- This emotional exchange strengthens the connection between [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]], as [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] feels understood and supported by someone they deeply trust.
    

- Departure and Future Resolve:  
      
    

- As the evening progresses, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] decides to stay with [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]]'s family for the night as a sign of respect and gratitude. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]] promises to convey [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]’s appreciation to the family and reassures [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|them]] that they will stand together in the coming battles.
    
- Before leaving, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]] expresses confidence that [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] will survive the war, and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] responds with a more cautious outlook, expressing discomfort with excessive hope.
    
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]] offers final words of encouragement, reminding [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] that they believe in [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|them]], and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] leaves, determined but cautious about the future.
    

- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]’s Reflection and the Braided Token:  
      
    

- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] takes note of the braid, which remains intact despite the emotional and physical toll of the day. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] makes sure that no one interferes with the braid, especially not Hannah, and ensures that it stays crisp, symbolizing both their bond with [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]] and their readiness for the Vex [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Arbitration\|Arbiter]] exam.
    

## [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]

- Setting: The conversation takes place in [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]'s small townhouse located in the shifter complex, which has two floors with a master bedroom and a smaller bedroom. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] normally shares the master bedroom with [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Hana, Temportal Disacossiate\|Hana]]. There are few personal items in the house, such as a clock and a pull-up bed for guests. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] notices the lack of photos of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] growing up, leading to a discussion about [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]'s past.  
      
    
- The Drawing: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] gives [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] a drawing of her playing in the snow, which she had made during their adventures before they met the rest of the party. She hopes it will serve as a picture of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], even though [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] has no pictures of himself in the house.  
      
    
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]’s Past: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] presses for more details about [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]’s past. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] reveals that he was rescued from [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Demons/CULTS/The White Spears\|the White Spears]] when he was around 15-16, and this trauma prevents him from having any pictures of his childhood.  
      
    
- Conversation About Family: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] shares details about her own family, explaining that she considers Baba (a non-blood family member) to be like a grandmother, and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Titania\|Titania]] like an aunt. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] finds this concept of “family” outside of blood ties confusing, especially as it pertains to Fae, as he was trained not to trust them  
      
    
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]’s Experiences with Fae: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] explains that he was trained to distrust the Fae, recalling how every act of kindness from the Fae is tied to a hidden deal. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]], however, is oblivious to the Fae’s manipulative nature and sees them as friendly, particularly her own connections to Fae like the Spring Court [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Princess\|princess]], [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Titania\|Titania]], and her pet, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/On the Epoch/Scribbles\|Scribbles]].  
      
    
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]’s Struggles with Understanding [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] expresses frustration with [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]’s naive view of the Fae, pointing out that they can ask for anything in return for help, including dangerous tasks. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] doesn’t understand the issue, and their differing views create tension.  
      
    
- Emotional Vulnerability: At one point, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] tries to comfort [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] with a hug, but [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] reacts awkwardly, reflecting past trauma from his time with [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Demons/CULTS/The White Spears\|the White Spears]]. Afterward, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] apologizes for trying to touch him without consent, emphasizing that she values their friendship deeply.  
      
    
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Demons/CULTS/The White Spears\|The White Spears]] and Trauma: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] opens up about his traumatic past, mentioning [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Demons/CULTS/The White Spears\|the White Spears]] and how they took him from his parents. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] tries to empathize but doesn’t fully understand [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]]'s experiences.  
      
    
- The Wild Hunt: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] reveals that the Wild Hunt began because she confided in [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Friendly/Titania\|Titania]] about her past, and this led to the hunt being called. [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], however, is more focused on his own trauma, particularly his disdain for the Fae, and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]’s innocence about their manipulative behavior creates a barrier in their conversation.  
      
    
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]]’s Family Background: [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Myria\|Myria]] also shares that her mother was once involved with the House of Flesh, a faction that had a significant impact on her life. This revelation is shocking to [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]], as the House of Flesh is responsible for the trauma [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/Viv\|Viv]] endured.
