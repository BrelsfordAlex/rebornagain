# Conversations 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tyrius and  Viv

- Initial Interaction Between Viv and Tyrius:  
      
    

- Viv, still adjusting to the situation, greets THEM (Tyrius). There's some confusion as to who Viv is speaking to, which leads to a conversation where Viv expresses her unease about the war and the safety of her clan.
    
- Tyrius acknowledges the worry, relating to Viv's feelings by mentioning their own family and the concern for them. This leads to a moment of trust, where Viv offers to meet Tyrius's family if possible.
    
- Tyrius mentions their sister, Amelie, and niece, Ella, emphasizing that their family would not be scared of Viv, even though Viv seems worried about how she might be perceived.
    

- ## Tyrius Reveals Family:  
      
    

- Tyrius explains that their sister, Amelie, is still alive and living in the family home. Despite the passage of time (70 years since Tyrius’s last time in this body), their family remains a part of their life. They also mention that they are surprised their family is still around.
    
- Viv, still unsure of how to interact with Tyrius’s family, expresses a desire to meet Tyrius but also shows hesitation, fearing the reaction to her appearance and complex nature.
    
- Tyrius reassures Viv, explaining that their family is understanding, even though there’s still a deep sense of apprehension from Viv.
    

- ## Introduction to Tyrius's Family:  
      
    

- Tyrius and Viv arrive at Amelie’s home, which is described as a quaint, old house with a thatched roof. Upon entering, Viv immediately shows respect by removing her shoes.
    
- Amelie, though an older woman, greets Tyrius with a warm hug, showing affection despite her age. She introduces herself as the head of the household, mentioning that her family has had interrogators before, and expresses openness to Viv.
    
- Viv, cautious due to her past experiences, is initially unsure of how to engage but is quickly soothed by Amelie’s tenderness and understanding nature.
    
- Viv, after some interaction, feels comfortable enough to remove her interrogator’s equipment and almost collapses in a mix of emotional exhaustion and physical weariness.
    

- ## Family Connections and Shared Moments:  
      
    

-  Amelie, a perceptive woman, notices Viv’s state of mind and gently pats Viv’s head while giving advice about the mismatched internal and external selves. This gesture brings comfort to Viv, though it is emotionally charged.
    
- A younger woman, Ella, enters with a baby boy, who immediately reaches out to grab Viv’s tail, drawing a light-hearted response from the family. Viv, shifting into her leopard form, humorously interacts with the baby, letting the child play with her fur.
    
- The scene continues with a lighthearted and endearing moment where Viv, still in leopard form, tries to keep the baby entertained, while Ella and Amelie find the interaction amusing.
    

- ## Meal and Personal Connections:  
      
    

- A hearty meal is served, with Amelie preparing a thick, savory soup. Tyrius, enjoying the nostalgic moment, expresses how much they’ve missed this kind of food, revealing a sense of deep attachment to their roots in Tallinn.
    
- In a playful exchange, Viv teases Tyrius about their apparent distaste for soup, joking about the inferiority of their mother's cooking.
    
- Tyrius laughs but insists that Viv’s mother’s soup is lovely, further displaying the familial bond shared in their conversation.
    
- The meal brings out more personal revelations, including Tyrius’s awkward but endearing confession of a past relationship with someone named Marcus. Tyrius blushes as they reveal the person’s identity, and Viv, noticing their discomfort, responds with supportive comments about their relationship.
    

- ## The Upcoming Battle and Bonding Ritual:  
      
    

- Tyrius, as they prepare for the upcoming war, discusses old traditions with Viv. One such tradition includes braiding each other’s hair to signify camaraderie before a battle. Tyrius presents Viv with a bead they found and fashioned into a token, sharing that it was a meaningful gesture among their friends before combat.
    
- Tyrius braids a strand of Viv’s hair, creating a symbolic connection between Tyrius. This act of solidarity reinforces their bond and the sense of mutual support. Tyrius emphasizes that they would stand by Viv’s side in the coming battle, reinforcing their commitment to one another.
    

- ## Viv’s Vulnerability and Support from Tyrius:  
      
    

- Viv experiences a moment of vulnerability, crying and expressing gratitude toward Tyrius for respecting their gender identity. Tyrius, with unwavering support, reassures Viv, saying they would never disrespect Tyrius and would stand up for them if others did.
    
- This emotional exchange strengthens the connection between Viv and Tyrius, as Viv feels understood and supported by someone they deeply trust.
    

- Departure and Future Resolve:  
      
    

- As the evening progresses, Viv decides to stay with Tyrius's family for the night as a sign of respect and gratitude. Tyrius promises to convey Viv’s appreciation to the family and reassures them that they will stand together in the coming battles.
    
- Before leaving, Tyrius expresses confidence that Viv will survive the war, and Viv responds with a more cautious outlook, expressing discomfort with excessive hope.
    
- Tyrius offers final words of encouragement, reminding Viv that they believe in them, and Viv leaves, determined but cautious about the future.
    

- Viv’s Reflection and the Braided Token:  
      
    

- Viv takes note of the braid, which remains intact despite the emotional and physical toll of the day. Viv makes sure that no one interferes with the braid, especially not Hannah, and ensures that it stays crisp, symbolizing both their bond with Tyrius and their readiness for the Vex Arbiter exam.
    

## Myria and Viv

- Setting: The conversation takes place in Viv's small townhouse located in the shifter complex, which has two floors with a master bedroom and a smaller bedroom. Viv normally shares the master bedroom with Hana. There are few personal items in the house, such as a clock and a pull-up bed for guests. Myria notices the lack of photos of Viv growing up, leading to a discussion about Viv's past.  
      
    
- The Drawing: Myria gives Viv a drawing of her playing in the snow, which she had made during their adventures before they met the rest of the party. She hopes it will serve as a picture of Viv, even though Viv has no pictures of herself in the house.  
      
    
- Viv’s Past: Myria presses for more details about Viv’s past. Viv reveals that she was rescued from the White Spears when she was around 15-16, and this trauma prevents her from having any pictures of her childhood.  
      
    
- Conversation About Family: Myria shares details about her own family, explaining that she considers Baba (a non-blood family member) to be like a grandmother, and Titania like an aunt. Viv finds this concept of “family” outside of blood ties confusing, especially as it pertains to Fae, as he was trained not to trust them.  
      
    
- Viv’s Experiences with Fae: Viv explains that he was trained to distrust the Fae, recalling how every act of kindness from the Fae is tied to a hidden deal. Myria, however, is oblivious to the Fae’s manipulative nature and sees them as friendly, particularly her own connections to Fae like the Spring Court princess, Titania, and her pet, Scribbles.  
      
    
- Myria’s Struggles with Understanding Viv: Viv expresses frustration with Myria’s naive view of the Fae, pointing out that they can ask for anything in return for help, including dangerous tasks. Myria doesn’t understand the issue, and their differing views create tension.  
      
    
- Emotional Vulnerability: At one point, Myria tries to comfort Viv with a hug, but Viv reacts awkwardly, reflecting past trauma from his time with the White Spears. Afterward, Myria apologizes for trying to touch him without consent, emphasizing that she values their friendship deeply.  
      
    
- The White Spears and Trauma: Viv opens up about his traumatic past, mentioning the White Spears and how they took him from his parents. Myria tries to empathize but doesn’t fully understand Viv's experiences.  
      
    
- The Wild Hunt: Myria reveals that the Wild Hunt began because she confided in Titania about her past, and this led to the hunt being called. Viv, however, is more focused on his own trauma, particularly his disdain for the Fae, and Myria’s innocence about their manipulative behavior creates a barrier in their conversation.  
      
    
- Myria’s Family Background: Myria also shares that her mother was once involved with the House of Flesh, a faction that had a significant impact on her life. This revelation is shocking to Viv, as the House of Flesh is responsible for the trauma Viv endured.  
      
    
- Myria’s Support: Myria insists that Viv is not a bad person, despite his self-blame, and reassures him that she sees him as family. This leads to a tense moment where Viv sarcastically refers to his "suicide plans," joking about his sense of worth.  
      
    
- Closing Thoughts: The conversation ends with Myria reassuring Viv that she values their friendship and will always be there for him, reinforcing her commitment to their bond despite their differing views.
