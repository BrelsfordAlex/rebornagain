Mamoru Gal’Bak (Fox Shifter)

- Wields ensouled demon weapons that are both powerful and unsettling.
    
- Her weapons, a pair of pistols, contain bound demons as power sources, and one pistol (“the black one”) is notably temperamental.
    
- She smacks the gun when it speaks, drawing quips and reactions from the group.
    
- [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] reacts warily to her aura and weapons, questioning their safety.
