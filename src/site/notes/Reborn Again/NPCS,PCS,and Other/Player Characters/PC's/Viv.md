Viv is a hardened but deeply loyal shifter warrior who carries the weight of both her bloodline and her own past mistakes. She is defined by her connection to **Honor**, the entity within her blade, which judges her worthiness and forces her to confront uncomfortable truths about herself. She is relentless in battle, favoring her gunblade and melee combat, and she fiercely protects those she loves, especially her mother, the **Baine Clan**, and her **vampire partner, Hana**. Though she masks her emotions with sharp wit and aggression, she holds a strong moral compass, often challenging authority and standing up for what she believes is right. Her struggles with the **House of Lament** and the **Red Robes** have shaped her into someone wary of deception, yet she is deeply committed to uncovering the truth. Viv is both a warrior and an investigator, balancing brute force with calculated insight, and she refuses to let anyone control her fate.
