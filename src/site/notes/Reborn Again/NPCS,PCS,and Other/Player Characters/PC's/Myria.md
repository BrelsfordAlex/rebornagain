DANCE OF THE DEAD REQUIRES CONCENTRATION - WHEN ATTACKED ROLL THE CON SAVE THINGY 

Countercharm- If you or a creature within 30 ft. fails a saving throw against an effect that applies the Charmed or Frightened condition, you can cause the save to be rerolled with Advantage.

Guidance gives Advantage (60 ft)

If you can see a creature's mouth while it is speaking a language you understand, you can interpret what it's saying by reading its lips.

Once per day you may cast counter spell at 6th Level, manifest a familiar like entity in the form of a grey misty fox that acts like a familiar from the find familiar spell for 3 hours or regain 2 bardic inspiration dice. You may do this a second time in a day, if you do you gain a level of exhaustion.

Imagination is PHYSICALLY inable to break any laws or bylaws  and has to listen to Myria for 5 weeks.
