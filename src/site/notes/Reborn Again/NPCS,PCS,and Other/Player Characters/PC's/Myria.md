###### Myria is a young, gifted bard and spellcaster who teeters between the light of creativity and the darkness of her past. She is bound to **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/Imagination\|Imagination]]**, an aspect of the "[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the Grey/The True End (The Grey)\|The True End]]," making her both a wielder of immense power and a danger to herself and others. Her **childhood was stolen by the House of Flesh**, and she has spent her life trying to piece together who she truly is. Recently, she discovered that she is **part vampire**, and unless she is bound to a progenitor by the age of 30, she risks losing her mind to bloodlust. This revelation, along with her **pact with [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Higher Powers/Shards of the White/Vengence\|Vengeance]]**, has made her more reckless, though she still seeks comfort in music and the friendships she has built. She thrives in chaos, playing music in bars, out-drinking shifters, and defeating devils in musical battles, but when confronted with the realities of war and destiny, she is overwhelmed by doubt and fear. Myria struggles with morality, questioning whether she can be both a protector and a killer, and whether the power she holds is a gift or a curse.

DANCE OF THE DEAD REQUIRES CONCENTRATION - WHEN ATTACKED ROLL THE CON SAVE THINGY 

Countercharm- If you or a creature within 30 ft. fails a saving throw against an effect that applies the Charmed or Frightened condition, you can cause the save to be rerolled with Advantage.

Guidance gives Advantage (60 ft)

If you can see a creature's mouth while it is speaking a language you understand, you can interpret what it's saying by reading its lips.

Once per day you may cast counter spell at 6th Level, manifest a familiar like entity in the form of a grey misty fox that acts like a familiar from the find familiar spell for 3 hours or regain 2 bardic inspiration dice. You may do this a second time in a day, if you do you gain a level of exhaustion.

Imagination is PHYSICALLY inable to break any laws or bylaws  and has to listen to Myria for 5 weeks.
