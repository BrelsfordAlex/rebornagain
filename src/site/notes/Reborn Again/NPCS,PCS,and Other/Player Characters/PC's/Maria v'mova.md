Maria is a seasoned warrior and strategist, a battle-worn veteran who has seen more conflict than most could endure. She carries the burden of leadership, having been promoted to **Company Captain**, responsible for rallying a veteran’s company in the face of an impending war. Maria is pragmatic, focused, and unwavering in her duty, but beneath her stoic exterior lies a deeply personal struggle with her past, the trauma of war, and the sacrifices she has made. She has fought **shadowed reapers, demons, and supernatural threats**, and she knows that survival depends on preparation and discipline. Despite her hardened nature, Maria is fiercely protective of her allies, guiding them with experience and wisdom, even when they frustrate her. She sees herself as a force of nature—strong, unyielding, and necessary—but she also carries the quiet hope that this fight will not break her as past battles have.
