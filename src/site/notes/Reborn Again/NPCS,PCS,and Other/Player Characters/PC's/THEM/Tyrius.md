Tyrius is the lingering shadow of a man who once was—a warrior, a leader, and a brother, now lost in the vast and fragmented consciousness of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]]. In life, he was known as Halcot, and his sister Amallie never stopped searching for him after his mysterious disappearance over **55 years ago**. As part of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]], he struggles with the duality of his existence—once human, now something else entirely, trapped in a body that is neither his nor truly alive. He is the voice of experience among them, often serious and duty-driven, carrying the weight of unfinished business. Though he has moments of clarity, his existence is largely defined by loss, both of self and of the life he once had, making him a tragic figure trying to find meaning in a world that has long since moved on.
