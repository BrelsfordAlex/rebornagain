Emery is the most determined of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]], a fighter who refuses to accept the limits of their existence. They have a **strong connection to the Spring Court**, where they were once someone of importance, though what they have become now is something far more complicated. They are deeply tied to **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Ava\|Ava]], the ancient warforged**, and seem to be the most willing to embrace the strange, shifting nature of their being. Emery is quick to act, sometimes impulsive, but always with the intent of moving forward rather than dwelling in the past like [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]]. They are a force of will, someone who pushes for answers, power, and understanding, even when it means taking risks others would hesitate to make. Among [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]], they are the one **most determined to shape their own destiny**, even if it means breaking everything they used to be in order to become something new.
