Ava is the **ancient sentinel of a forgotten world**, a warforged entity who once served as the final guardian of the **Magus Vaults**, containing weapons capable of reshaping reality itself. Created for **war and preservation**, Ava was built to last, but even she was not immune to the passage of time. Her **shutdown centuries ago** left her in a state of stasis, only to awaken to find herself a part of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]], merged with these lost souls in a way she does not fully understand. Ava carries a mechanical **precision and cold efficiency**, but there are cracks in her programmingâ€”fragments of lost memories, moments of human-like emotion, and the undeniable **awareness that she is more than just a machine**. She struggles with identity, much like the others, but her conflict is between the logic of her design and the undeniable fact that she has changed. Whether that makes her a weapon, a guide, or something else entirely remains to be seen.
