Hawthorn is the inventive mind within [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]], a former **tinkerer and magical engineer** whose memories are filled with blueprints, explosions, and the hum of warforged technology. He thrives in the world of machines and logic, working alongside **Elder Brian** to create gravity bombs and experiment with lost magics. Unlike [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]], who is haunted by the past, Hawthorn embraces the present with an almost reckless curiosity, eager to push the limits of what can be built, destroyed, or reshaped. He has a dry sense of humor, often serving as the sarcastic and practical voice within [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]], though beneath his bravado is a deep-seated frustration with the **mysteries surrounding their existence**. He wants answersâ€”about who they were, why they exist, and what they are meant to become. Until then, he buries himself in work, tinkering with the future while the past refuses to let go.
