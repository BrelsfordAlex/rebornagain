T.H.E.M is a collective entity composed of four distinct individuals—[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]], [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Hawthorn\|Hawthorn]], [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Marla\|Marla]], and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Emery\|Emery]]—who exist within the same consciousness, making them a fusion of lost souls and advanced magic-tech. At their core, they struggle with identity, memory loss, and their purpose, particularly as they uncover the remnants of an ancient warforged past. **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Hawthorn\|Hawthorn]]** is an inventive tinkerer with a history of working on magical technology, crafting gravity bombs, and collaborating with Elder Brian. **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]]**, once a mortal named Halcot, died over 50 years ago but lives on within the entity, a relic of a past long forgotten. **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Emery\|Emery]]** has ties to the Spring Court and a powerful connection to lost magics, particularly surrounding the high magus Zeref and vaults of ancient weapons. **[[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Marla\|Marla]]** serves as an anchor, trying to make sense of their shared existence while unraveling the mysteries of their fragmented memories. T.H.E.M exists as both a person and a force—bound to the balance between past and present, light and dark, knowledge and destruction.
