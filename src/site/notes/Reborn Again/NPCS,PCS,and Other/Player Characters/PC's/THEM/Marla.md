Marla is the quiet strength of [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]], the glue that holds the fractured pieces together. She is the **most emotionally grounded** of the four, balancing [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Tyrius\|Tyrius]]’s regret, [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Hawthorn\|Hawthorn]]’s ambition, and [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/Emery\|Emery]]’s determination with her own quiet resilience. While the others focus on unraveling their shared past, Marla is more concerned with **navigating the present**, ensuring they function as a whole rather than as broken pieces of lost souls. She is observant, strategic, and deeply protective of the few bonds they have managed to form outside of themselves. While she doesn’t often let her emotions rule her, she has moments of deep introspection, questioning whether they truly belong in this world or if they are just remnants of something long gone. If [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/Player Characters/PC's/THEM/T.H.E.M\|T.H.E.M]] is a machine trying to find its purpose, Marla is the one making sure it doesn’t fall apart before it gets there.
