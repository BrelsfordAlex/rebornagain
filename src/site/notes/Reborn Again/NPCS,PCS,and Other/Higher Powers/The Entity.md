### About The Abolethic Entity
---
- The entity that emerged from [[Reborn Again/NPCS,PCS,and Other/NPCS/Neutral/Maledos\|Maledos]]' corpse is **abolethic** and part of a **god**, not just a power or an eidolon.
- The entity has a **disciple**, and its goal is to be **freed**.
The entity formed a vaguely humanoid shape and spoke telepathically to everyone, introducing itself without words.
